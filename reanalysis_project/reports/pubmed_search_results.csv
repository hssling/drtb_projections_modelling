40844110,"Multicentric validation of the PathoDetect™ MTB RIF & INH assay for simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, & drug resistance to rifampicin & isoniazid in presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis & drug-resistant TB patients.",The Indian journal of medical research,2025,Choudhary H; Malik G; Chauhan DS; Bhalla M; Dusthackeer A; Desikan P; Giri S; Kumar S; Jayaprakasam M; Singh AV; Sethi P; Reza MS; Mythily V; Thiyagarajan V; Panwalkar N; Tripathy J; Mani D; Singh D; Ramesh PM; Chalga MS; Rani R; Gupta N; Pandey RM; Singh M,"Background & objectives Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health concern, with India accounting for 26 per cent of the global burden. Despite advances, access to rapid molecular diagnostics is limited, and the assays currently used in National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) do not detect isoniazid (INH) resistance upfront. PathoDetect™ MTB RIF & INH is an indigenous closed-system assay that simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and resistance to rifampicin (RIF) and INH. This study evaluated its diagnostic characteristics. Methods In this cross-sectional multicenter study conducted at six TB reference laboratories in India, 1039 participants were enrolled (718 presumptive pulmonary TB, 321 presumptive multidrug resistant TB; MDR-TB). PathoDetect™'s discriminatory ability was assessed using the measures sensitivity and specificity, and its diagnostic performance using positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Liquid culture served as the reference standard for MTB detection, while phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) and line probe assay (LPA) as reference standards for RIF and INH resistance detection. Results For MTB detection in presumptive pulmonary TB (PTB), PathoDetect™ showed a sensitivity of 98.1 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.1-99.2], specificity of 94.2 per cent (95% CI: 91-96.5), PPV of 94.9 per cent (95% CI: 92.2-96.9), and NPV of 97.8 per cent (95% CI: 95.5-99.1) with near-perfect agreement with Truenat® (k=0.89). Among 514 confirmed TB cases, PathoDetect™ detected RIF resistance with a sensitivity of 86.5 per cent (95% CI: 80.2-91.5), specificity of 91.6 per cent (95% CI: 88.2-94.3), PPV of 82.3 per cent (95% CI: 75.6-87.8), and NPV of 93.8 per cent (95% CI: 90.7-96.1). For INH resistance, sensitivity was 88.9 per cent (95% CI: 84.1-92.6), specificity 87 per cent (95% CI: 82.4-90.8), PPV 85.6 per cent (95% CI: 80.5-89.8), and NPV 90 per cent (95% CI: 85.7-93.4) using pDST as reference. Truenat® MTB-RIF showed comparable performance for RIF resistance detection (k=0.75). Compared to line probe assay (LPA), PathoDetect™ demonstrated higher sensitivity (93.4 vs. 88.8%), specificity (98.2 vs. 93.9%), PPV (96.1 vs. 86.8%) and NPV (97 vs. 94.9%) for RIF resistance detection over Truenat®. Interpretation & conclusions PathoDetect™ is a reliable molecular diagnostic tool for detection of MTB and resistance to RIF & INH. The assay showed better RIF resistance detection compared to INH. Its high sensitivity and specificity indicate strong discriminatory ability, while PPV and NPV demonstrate reasonably good diagnostic performance in the study population. These findings support PathoDetect™ as a promising alternative for rapid TB diagnosis, particularly in high-burden settings."

This open-label, multicentre, stratified, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted in ten hospitals in India, Kazakhstan, Lesotho, Pakistan, Peru, and Viet Nam. Participants aged 15 years or older who had pulmonary tuberculosis with resistance to rifampicin and fluoroquinolones were included. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to the BDLC group (all-oral bedaquiline 400 mg once per day for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg three times per week, delamanid 100 mg twice per day, linezolid 600 mg once per day for 16 weeks and then either 300 mg once per day or 600 mg three times per week, and clofazimine 100 mg once per day) or the control group (individualised WHO-recommended longer standard of care). Randomisation was stratified by country and baseline disease extent. BDLC was administered for 39 weeks (9-month regimen) for extensive disease and 24 weeks (6-month regimen) for limited disease and extended to 9 months for those with a positive culture at 8 weeks or later or a missing 8-week culture result. Site staff and participants were not masked, whereas investigators and laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment.

Conventional diagnostic methods, such as smear microscopy, lack sensitivity and timeliness. This study evaluates the prognostic value of time to positivity (TTP) from liquid culture and cycle threshold (CT) values from GeneXpert This study aimed to assess the utility of baseline mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) TTP and GeneXpert CTvalues as early biomarkers for prognosis and the risk of MDR-TB development in smear-positive relapse and default PTB patients. This cross-sectional study with a prospective arm enrolled 72 adult PTB patients (relapse, default, or treatment failure). Sputum samples underwent smear microscopy, MGIT liquid culture, and GeneXpert testing. Baseline and three-month follow-up results were compared. TTP and CT values were correlated with microbiological outcomes. MGIT culture was positive in 52.8% (38/72) of patients (mean TTP: 26.5 days). In comparison, GeneXpert detected Baseline MGIT TTP demonstrates significant prognostic potential in identifying patients with PTB at risk of treatment failure or MDR development. In contrast, GeneXpert CT values, while useful diagnostically, were less predictive of outcomes. Incorporating TTP into routine clinical practice could enable earlier intervention and improve TB control strategies in high-burden settings."
40669825,"Lineage identification and mutation profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A study from National Reference Laboratory, India.",Indian journal of medical microbiology,2025,Yadav RN; Bhalla M; Shenai S; Sharma SK; Singhal R,"The present study aimed to find out the most prevalent lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and analysis of their mutation profile conferring to drug resistance at National Reference Laboratory (NRL) in New Delhi. A total 212 liquid culture MTB isolates of presumptive multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients were selected at NRL and subjected to whole genome sequencing (Illumina Miseq, USA). The genome sequencing data of 194 samples was successfully obtained in fastq files from instrument and analysed by Mykrobe predictor for lineage and mutation identification conferring drug resistance. In a total 194 isolates, the number of isolates belonging to lineage and sub-lineage of lineage 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 13 (6.7 %), 63 (32.4 %), 82 (42.2 %) and 28 (14.4 %) respectively. Out of total 194 culture isolates analysed, 179 harbor at least one or more mutations. Among these 179 mutated isolates, following gene mutations were found in either single or in combinations: rpoB (146, 81.5 %), katG (138, 77 %), pncA (62, 34.6), gyrA (121, 67.5 %), embB (106, 59.2 %), rpsL (86,48 %) followed by fabG1 (31, 17.3 %), embA (18,10 %), gid (6,3.3 %), inhA (4), eis (4,2.2 %), rrs (17, 9.4 %). Lineage 2 was found to be most mutated MTB strains having atleast one or more mutations. In lineage 2, the frequency of rpoB, katG, gyrA, embB, and pncA gene mutations was 92 %, 82.5 %, 93.6 %, 68.2 %, and 61.9 %, respectively. This was higher than in lineage 1 (30.7 %, 53.8 %, 15.2 %, 38.4 %, 0 % respectively), lineage 3 (69.5 %, 68.2 %, 46.3 %, 46.3 %, 24.3 % respectively), and Euro-American lineage 4 (74 %, 62.9 %, 48.1 %, 40.7 %, 26.9 % respectively). Based on this study, lineage 3 may the most prevalent strain of MTB in north India. More attention required to take care patients having Lineage 2 infection to break chain of transmission as it was found to be most mutated strains."
40540654,Diagnostic Modalities for Detecting Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis and Resistance Patterns of Rifampicin and Isoniazid at a Referral Hospital: A Retro Prospective Study.,International journal of mycobacteriology,2025,Kumar A; Singh AK; Gaur V; Mishra AK; Mehta A; Singh RK,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, results in approximately 1.5 million annual deaths globally. Diagnosing extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) remains challenging due to the invasive nature of sample collection and limitations in conventional diagnostic sensitivity. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of Xpert®Mycobacterium tuberculosis/Rifampicin (MTB/RIF), a nucleic acid amplification test, against direct microscopy for EPTB specimens. In addition, we compare the detection of first-line anti-tubercular drug resistance between Xpert® MTB/RIF and the MTB-DR plus line probe assay. From January 2022, to April 2023, 2839 clinically suspected EPTB specimens were collected from patients referred to tertiary care hospitals in Gorakhpur, India. Specimens included lymph node aspirates, pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue biopsies, processed according to the Indian National Tuberculosis Elimination Program protocols. Diagnostic evaluations employed microscopy (acid-fast bacilli staining), Xpert® MTB/RIF, and MTB-DR plus assays. Of 2839 specimens, Xpert® MTB/RIF detected M. tuberculosis in 339 cases (11.9%), significantly outperforming microscopy (183 cases, 6.4%). The highest positivity rates occurred in tissue biopsies and lymph node aspirates (29%), while genitourinary TB was least frequent. Rifampicin resistance was identified in 14 cases (4.13%), all confirmed as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) by MTB-DR plus. Xpert® MTB/RIF demonstrated superior sensitivity over microscopy, supporting its utility for EPTB diagnosis in low-resource settings. The high MDR-TB prevalence (4.13%) underscores the need for rapid molecular diagnostics to guide treatment. However, global EPTB burden estimates remain inconsistent, necessitating standardized surveillance and diagnostic protocols to improve detection accuracy and inform public health strategies."

Therefore, this study was conducted to elucidate the complete genetic profiles of drug-sensitive (DS), and drug-resistant TB isolates using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). The study includes a set of sputum specimens containing five DS-TB, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) from distinct individuals. The identification and susceptibility was confirmed using GeneXpert assay, GenoType MTBDR plus assay, and GenoTypeMTBDRsl assay. Furthermore, specimens were cultured using the BD BACTEC MGIT 960 and subsequently confirmed through Capilia rapid kit. WGS was employed for the identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) lineages, and spoligotypes. The H37Rv was used as a positive control. The findings of WGS showed, all the MDR-TB and XDR-TB isolates exhibited non-synonymous mutation (Ser450Leu, Gln432Leu, and His445Gln) within the rpoB gene. The isolates were simultaneously harboring mutations at fabG1-8T > C, fabG1-17G > T, fabG1-15C > T, and inhA-154G > A. One DS-TB isolate was carrying resistance mutations in the rrs gene at position 517C > T, while three MDR-TB isolates turned out to be pre-XDR-TB carrying mutations associated with fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance (gyrA Ala90Val, gyrA Asp94His, and gyrA Asp94 Gly). The study reports novel mutations pncA391dupG and for the first time mutation in thyX gene in clinical isolates of MTBC. Most of the MDR/XDR-TB isolates were predominantly associated with the Beijing sub-lineage within the East Asian Lineage 2. In conclusion, our study highlighted the challenges surrounding the rapid identification and essential information regarding the genetic diversity of TB strains which contribute valuable insights into the TB epidemiology."

The emergence of resistance to BDQ, a key drug in treating MDR-TB, poses significant threats to TB treatment effectiveness. The National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases in Delhi and the Médecins Sans Frontières clinic in Mumbai provide BDQ, delamanid, and carbapenem-based regimens for patients with suspected or confirmed treatment failure. BDQ phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (DST) was performed for all BDQ-exposed patients. Treatment regimens were individualized based on exposure history, comorbidities, drug interactions, prior adverse drug reactions, and DST results. Of 117 BDQ-exposed patients from December 2020-December 2022, 42 (36%) exhibited a BDQ-resistant strain. Median (IQR) age was 24 (22-32) years, with 63 (54%) females and 94% with pulmonary TB. Patients with a BDQ-resistant strain were older (median age: 27 vs 23 years; P = .04), more likely to have lung cavities (risk ratio [RR]: 1.8; 95%-CI: 1.1-3.1; P = .02), and be resistant to clofazimine (RR: 2.3; 95%-CI: 1.5-3.6; P = .001). Overall, 102 patients initiated treatment. Patients with BDQ-resistance had higher risk of unfavorable outcomes compared with BDQ-susceptible patients (RR:2.1; 95%-CI: 1.5-2.8; P < .001). Overall, 87% (33/38) of patients with BDQ-resistance experienced unfavorable treatment outcomes: 15 (40%) died, 15 (40%) had treatment failure, and 3 (8%) were lost-to-follow-up. The study highlights a concerning rate of BDQ-resistance among previously treated patients, resulting in poor treatment outcomes. To prevent treatment failure, we recommend implementing BDQ-DST, developing affordable and accurate rapid tests for BDQ-resistance, and intensifying research and development efforts for newer TB drugs."

We investigated the prevalence and genetic patterns of pre-XDR and XDRTB, by employing second-line line probe assays (SL-LPA). This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Intermediate Reference Laboratory, from November 2023 to May 2024. We screened 1253 samples via Genxpert followed by florescence microscopy, and mutational/resistance analysis via the GenoType MTBDRplus/FL-LPA (first line-line probe assay) and MTBDRsl/SL-LPA for the mutation patterns. We identified 355 rifampicin drug-resistant TB isolates, 260 of which were smear positive samples obtained for FL-LPA and SL-LPA. Finally, 255 MDR/RR-TB patients were analyzed and 73(28.62%) patients exhibited second-line drug (SLD) resistance. Among the cases, 65(89.04%) were found to be resistant solely to fluoroquinolones (FQ), whereas 3(4.11%) were resistant only to aminoglycosides (pre-XDR TB). However, 5(6.8%) patients were resistant to both FQ and aminoglycosides (XDR-TB). We also found that males 44(60.37%) were more affected by SLD resistance than 29(39.72%) females, however SLD resistant females were younger than males (26.97 ± 14.84 vs. 35.84 ± 15.26, p = 0.016). The number of previously treated patients were significantly greater in SLD-resistance than in SLD-sensitive patients. The most common mutation in the gyrA gene was D94G, which was observed in 52(71.23%) cases, followed by A90V in 10(13.69%), D94N and D94A in 4(5.48%), whereas the rrs gene presented the rrsMUT1 (A1401G) mutation in 7(9.58%) and the rrsMUT2(G1484T) mutation in 1(1.37%) of SLD-resistant patients. The alarming rate of SLD-resistance among MDR-TB patients highlights the need for improved management strategies focused on early and accurate diagnosis of DR-TB."

Through a sequencing-based strategy, this study seeks to comprehend the diversity and drug resistance pattern in the eastern region. A total of 102 M. tuberculosis isolates from North East (n = 54), and Odisha (n = 48) were sequenced along with 7 follow up isolates from Sikkim. The pre-XDR and XDR isolates diagnosed as per the NTEP diagnostic algorithm were subjected for phenotypic second-line liquid culture drug susceptibility testing in MGIT-960 system. After filtering out low quality isolates based on taxonomic classification and depth of coverage, variant calling was performed. We observed a high prevalence of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) lineage 2 (52/54) isolates in northeast whereas there was a mixed representation of lineage 1 (30/48) & lineage 3 (11/48) in Odisha. The MDR-TB isolates from Sikkim posed a high rate (51/53) of fluoroquinolone resistance and pairwise SNV distances (≤10) indicating possible local transmission events in the region. We observed occurrence of genetic variations in genes associated with bedaquiline and delamanid resistance. Our findings show the diversity of M. tuberculosis vary across the eastern regions, in north eastern states lineage 2 has a dominant presence while lineage 1 and 3 has mixed representation in Odisha. The high prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in north eastern region associated with variations in gyrA gene and may have been caused by local transmission events based on genomic similarities."

The impact of this shift in policy on severity of disease was studied, and comparisons were drawn between the year 2015 and 2020. This was an observational study conducted between 2020 and 2021. Seventy patients of MDR-TB with or without additional drug resistance, hospitalized in the year 2015 and 2020, were studied. The study reveals a substantial reduction in the median time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis between 2015 and 2020. Specifically, the median duration decreased from 12 weeks in 2015 to 8 weeks in 2020. Moreover, we found that in 2015, all cases under study had a history of tuberculosis in comparison to 2020. Additionally, there was a higher incidence of anemia in 2015 compared to 2020. In the radiological examination, it was observed that in 2015, a higher frequency of cases exhibited cavitations, bronchiectasis, and fibrosis on chest X-rays compared to the findings in 2020. The mean cavity size in 2015 measured 6.73 cm, while in 2020, it averaged 4.06 cm. Additionally, we noticed a higher occurrence of significantly advanced cases in 2015 in contrast to 2020. The implementation of the new policy of upfront DST was noted to decrease the time required for diagnosis and bacterial load as ascertained from degree of sputum smear positivity, radiological lesions, and severity of anemia."

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Shatabdi Hospital in Mumbai between 2019-2021.We described the clinical and demographic characteristics, treatment outcomes, and risk factors for unfavourable outcomes among patients with INH mono-resistant TB treated with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and levofloxacin (LfxREZ) for a duration of 6 months. Among 3105 patients with drug-resistant TB initiated on treatment, 217 (7 %) had INH mono-resistant TB. Of these, 54 % (117/217) were female, with a median age of 26 years (interquartile range: 20-40). The majority (88 %; 191/217) presented with pulmonary TB, and most (87 %; 188/217) had favourable treatment outcomes, including treatment completion (52 %; 112/217) and cure (35 %; 76/217). Unfavourable outcomes, including treatment failure (2.3 %; 5/217), loss to follow-up (9.2 %; 20/217), or death (1.8 %; 4/217), were observed in 13 % (29/217) of patients. A total of ten (5 %) patients experienced at least one non-severe adverse drug reaction. Factors associated with unfavourable outcomes included severe thinness (p = 0.019) and male gender (p = 0.012). Treating INH mono-resistant patients with LfxREZ resulted in satisfactory outcomes and low toxicity. It is important to rule out drug resistance to INH while determining the treatment regimen."

The management of this severe form of TB is associated with a number of issues like long treatment durations, high pill burden, and multiple adverse drug reactions. Efforts are on through various research studies and trials for finding solutions to the issues linked to the current drug regimens against drug-resistant tuberculosis. One such remarkable development is the introduction of bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin (BPaLM)-based regimens to fight against two of the most severe forms of tuberculosis, i.e., multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB and XDR-TB).

Vitamin D deficiency and response to treatment have been demonstrated in patients with active TB in several studies, but not in MDR-TB patients, which is a new observation in the present study. To study the time to initial sputum culture conversion and to associate baseline vitamin D levels and response to treatment in patients with PTB Cat I and MDR-TB. A total of 897 North Indian participants were recruited and divided into three groups: treatment-naïve PTB Cat I, MDR-TB, and healthy controls. Serum biochemistry, including 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium, was measured in all participants with PTB, Cat I, and MDR-TB. PTB Cat I patients had high bacillary load grading at baseline compared to 2 Low serum vitamin D deficiency was observed in both groups during treatment and is one of the important factors responsible for susceptibility to TB in both groups; however, its significance is uncertain. Patients with continuous positive sputum for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) had a worse prognosis than those with sputum bacteriology conversion. Two months into a treatment regimen, sputum smear conversions may be a useful indicator of an MDR-TB patient's prognosis."

TB is transmitted through droplet infection and the transmission occurs when a person inhales droplet nuclei containing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Infection control practices play a major role in controlling the TB infection in healthcare settings and further prevents TB infection in the HCWs. The aim of the study is to conduct the cross sectional study for infection control practices in DOTS cum Sputum Microscopy Centre's under NTEP in Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh) & Dehradun (Uttarakhand) districts with the objective to assess the compliance of infection control measures by HCWs in DOTS cum Sputum Microscopy Centre's and to suggest the suitable measures and/or model to reduce the transmission of infection to the HCWs and to the community at large. The cross sectional study is conducted for two years in two districts of different state having high burden of TB disease in UP and low burden of disease in UK state. All DOTS cum Sputum Microscopy centres of both selected districts i.e. 100% sample size are covered in the study. Hand washing is the most efficient and cost-effective practice for prevention and control of infection. In Dehradun district 66.66% (12) centers and in Ghaziabad district 57.14% (16) centers have adequate hand washing facility available at DOTS and sputum microscopy lab. Unavailability of adequate PPE will lead to the infection. In Dehradun district, 55.56% (10) centers have adequate PPE available whereas in Ghaziabad District 21.43% (6) centers have adequate PPE available. Training on infection prevention and control for HCWs are provided in 27.78% (5) DOTS/sputum microscopy center in Dehradun whereas none of the DOTS/sputum microscopy center in Ghaziabad district are given training on infection prevention & control for HCWs in last one year. Adequate ventilation plays an important role in transmission of TB/MDR TB or any respiratory infection. HCWs working in DOTS/Sputum microscopy center are at risk to contact the TB/MDR TB infection if there is no proper ventilation in their working places. In 33.33% (6) DOTS/sputum microscopy center in Dehradun & 28.57% (8) in Ghaziabad district have adequate ventilation. Layout of DOTS room and for sputum microscopy center are suggested to reduce the risk of transmission of TB/MDR-TB and other respiratory pathogens amongst HCWs who are working in DOTS cum sputum microscopy center. DOTS cum Sputum Microscopy Centers of both districts in different states are having deficient infection control practices. Staff is not adequately trained in infection prevention and control practices."

The disease is highly prevalent and is the second most common cause of death worldwide after COVID-19. Apart from sputum specimen, it is exceedingly difficult to diagnose due to its paucibacillary nature. The current study was intended to evaluate the accuracy of Smart Sure™ MTB and multidrug-resistant-TB (MDR-TB) kits (Genetix Biotech Asia Pvt. Ltd., India) with Xpert ultra and Mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture on nonsputum specimens from TB suspects. A total of 205 nonsputum specimens were received between October 2023 and May 2024 at Intermediate Reference Laboratory, Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Xpert ultra and Smart Sure™ MTB and MDR-TB tests were done directly on samples. However, processed specimens were used for MGIT culture and drug-susceptibility testing (DST). Invalid and MGIT contaminated specimens were excluded from the final calculation. Overall, sensitivity and specificity of Smart Sure™ MTB screening kit was 71.59% and 98.28%, respectively, with Xpert ultra and 68.35% and 90.83%, respectively, with MGIT culture. While comparing with both Xpert ultra and MGIT-DST to detect rifampicin (RIF) resistant, Smart Sure™ MDR-TB kits showed sensitivity of 75.0% and 100% of specificity. However, for isoniazid (INH) resistance, Smart Sure™ MDR-TB kits showed 100% of sensitivity and specificity with MGIT-DST. For the detection of MTB and its drug-resistance patterns (RIF and INH) in the specimens other than sputum, Smart Sure™ MTB and MDR-TB kits could play a vital role in TB endemic countries. While comparing the set-ups and skilled staffs, it required almost same as compared with previously approved WHO diagnostics used in resource-limited countries."

Standardized MDR TB regimen had high default rates, more side effects and poor treatment outcomes. Bedaquiline is a newer anti-tubercular drug which has made oral regimens possible for MDR TB. We aimed to study the outcomes of MDR TB patients treated with Bdq containing regimens. 155 patients of MDR TB on Bdq containing regimen enrolled at GMC, Patiala under NTEP from 2017 to 2020 were enrolled retrospectively. Out of 155 patients enrolled, 82 (52.9 %) were cured, 31 (20 %) completed treatment, 18 (11.6 %) defaulted, 22 (14.2 %) died and 2 (0.12 %) failed treatment.

To study symptomatic, linezolid-attributable ADRs in TB patients initiated on all oral longer bedaquiline-based treatment regime for multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant (MDR/RR)-TB under programmatic conditions. It was a multicenter, retrospective study of people with MDR/RR-TB in nine TB units in Nagpur, India, from March 2020 to April 2022. The study consisted of a sample size of 106 individuals with multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis out of a total of 110 individuals with the disease. Of these, 45 (42.45%) experienced linezolid ADRs, with an incidence of 11.37 cases per 1000 person-weeks. These patients were significantly younger (31.24 ± 11.13 years) and more likely to be female (27, 50%) than those without ADRs. ADR severity was mild in 20 (44.45%), moderate in 15 (33.33%), and severe in 10 (22.22%) patients. The most common ADR was peripheral neuropathy (42, 93.33%), followed by lactic acidosis (3, 6.67%), anemia (2, 4.44%), and optic neuritis (2, 4.44%). Dosing was reduced in 17 (37.78%) patients, and linezolid was withdrawn entirely in 19 (42.22%) patients. Only 9 (20%) patients continued linezolid unmodified. For mild to moderate linezolid-associated symptomatic peripheral neuropathy, symptom management with or without dose reduction is an effective strategy; however, immediate linezolid withdrawal is necessary in severe or life-threatening peripheral neuropathy cases. After a mean follow-up of 41 ± 21.33 weeks, ADR symptoms resolved completely in 4 (6.67%) patients and decreased in 42 (93.33%) patients. Linezolid ADRs, often neuropathy, frequently occur in patients on an all-oral bedaquiline-based treatment regime for MDR/RR-TB. Women and younger patients are more likely to experience these ADRs, usually mild to moderate in severity. Management of symptomatic linezolid-associated peripheral neuropathy should be based on ADR severity. These ADRs often affect linezolid dosing, so it is important to identify and manage them early."
38825150,Silent epidemic of silicotuberculosis in India and emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis?,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2024,Singh D; Sarkar B; Yadav S; Sarkar K,"India's projected silica-dust-exposed workers will be 52 million at the end of 2025. The elimination of tuberculosis (TB) is also targeted in India by 2025. Scientists in India have already pointed out that unless silicosis is controlled, the said elimination will be difficult to achieve. This study provides evidence of an increasing incidence of tuberculosis (TB) including multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) with mortality owing to treatment failure among the silica dust-exposed workers compared to their unexposed counterpart. It was also observed that TB as well as MDR-TB were directly proportional to the dose and/or duration of silica dust exposure (progression of silica-dust induced lung damage). This means the occurrence of both TB and MDR-TB is lowest in the unexposed group, moderate in the radiologically negative but silica dust-exposed group (subradiological silicosis owing to moderate exposure), and highest in the radiologically confirmed silicotic workers (maximally exposed group). Because India has a huge burden of silicosis cases, the said cases are vulnerable to pulmonary TB, including MDR-TB. The study indicates there will be an emergence of MDR-TB among the silica dust-exposed workers unless appropriate intervention measures are initiated with immediate effect. Failure to do so, it will probably lead to a silent epidemic of silicotuberculosis in India shortly. It is important to have tools to detect silicosis cases quickly and at an early stage to identify a vulnerable population and adopt an effective intervention measure."

This study indicates the clinicians' reasons for sending samples for WGS, which is for difficult-to-treat cases and/or relapse and treatment failure. The study reports a significant proportion of cases with pre-XDR-TB strains that warrant policy makers' attention. It reflects the current iterative nature of the diagnostic tests under programmatic conditions that leads to delays in appropriate diagnosis and empirical treatment.

The development of resistance to two of the most effective medications, rifampicin, and isoniazid, is the largest worldwide challenge in the management of TB. An epidemiological indicator used to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB management program is the initial medication resistance level. Our search for published papers in English using Medical Subject Heading phrases was conducted through PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. We also looked through several official sources to learn the most recent information on multi-drug resistance in India. Multi-drug resistance tuberculosis is a significant risk to human health globally. Stigmatization or discrimination of those who have TB or who are impacted by it can make the disease more difficult to manage medically and socially, and it is ultimately responsible for missed opportunities for diagnosis and treatment, interruptions of care, and unsuccessful outcomes. Eliminating TB is complicated by stigma."

As a part of larger cross-sectional mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative data) study on pathways to MDR-TB care, here we present the qualitative component. We interviewed 128 (56 men and 72 women) individuals who had MDR-TB, aged > = 15 years, registered and treated under the National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) in Pune city of India. We carried out thematic analysis of participants' narratives. We found that delays in diagnosis, lack of counseling, late referral to the NTEP and unwarranted expenditure were the main barriers to care that study participants experienced in the private sector. Provider dismissal of symptoms, non-courteous behavior, lack of hygiene in the referral centers, forced stay with other patients and lack of support for psychological/psychiatric problems were identified as a few additional challenges that participants faced at the NTEP care centers. Using qualitative data from experiences of participants with MDR-TB, we identify patients' several unmet needs, attention to which can improve MDR-TB care. Educating private providers about MDR-TB risk and available rapid molecular assays can help the timely diagnosis of MDR-TB and reduce patients' out of pocket costs. At the RNTCP/NTEP, measures such as training health workers to build rapport with patients, maintaining hygienic environments in the health centers with adequate isolation of participants with MDR from other serious cases, referral of patients with psychiatric symptoms to mental health specialists and monitoring drug shortages can help in improving care delivery."

India features in the list of TB high burden countries, HIV-TB high burden and MDR-TB high burden countries. The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children is difficult as they tend to swallow the sputum, invasive techniques of gastric aspirates needs to be followed and the disease itself is paucibacillary. The disease progresses rapidly in young children and hence rapid diagnosis is needed. Obtaining appropriate respiratory samples for diagnosis is difficult especially in primary care settings. Stool sample is easy to obtain and since children swallow sputum, it can be used to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis. With this background, a pilot study was planned to evaluate the accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the detection of MTB in stool specimens obtained from pediatric pulmonary TB patients confirmed either by gastric lavage(GL) or sputum(SP) Xpert MTB/RIF assay. In addition, the results of microscopy of stool specimen were compared with that of gastric lavage/ sputum (GL/SP) specimen by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) and fluorescent light-emitting diode (LED) staining. A prospective study was carried out on 50 GL/SP Xpert MTB/RIF assay positive children (0-14 years). Stool specimens from these children were processed for Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The GL/SP and stool specimens were processed for ZN and Auramine O fluorescent microscopy as well. Fluorescent staining detected acid fast bacilli (AFB) in 24 GL/SP and 16 stool specimens as compared to 20 GL/SP and 10 stool specimens by ZN staining. Stool Xpert MTB/ RIF assay was positive in 29 out of 50 children. Rifampicin resistance was detected in 13 of the 50 (26%) GL/SP specimens. Of these 13 children, rifampicin resistance was detected in 7 stool specimens, rifampicin indeterminate resistance was detected in one specimen and in the remaining 5 children, M.tuberculosis was not detected in stool. Stool is a good non-invasive specimen for the detection of pulmonary TB in children, especially in remote areas, where invasive techniques cannot be performed for sample collection."
37919487,Current Epidemiology of Pediatric Tuberculosis.,Indian journal of pediatrics,2024,Mane SS; Shrotriya P,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease that is a major cause of ill health and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Children act as reservoirs of infection out of which future cases develop. Without the successful detection and treatment of TB infection and disease in children, elimination strategies for TB will be ineffective. India has a severe problem with TB in children, which accounts for around 31% of the global pediatric TB load. However, over the past 10 y, children have consistently made up 6-7% of all patients treated yearly under the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP). There is an estimated detection gap of 56% in India, which is the reason for many missed cases of TB in children. Only 3% of children less than 14 y with MDR/RR-TB, are reported from India, which again is an underestimation of the actual incident cases. Population density, housing and living conditions, environmental conditions, cultural practices, age of the child, exposure to tobacco and other environmental pollutants, the virulence of the mycobacterial strain and their genetics, host genetics, BCG vaccination, malnutrition, immunodeficiency are some of the risk factors for TB exposure, infection and disease in children. Understanding the natural history as well as the epidemiology of childhood TB is important to assess which children are the most vulnerable. It would also guide us in understanding the burden of pediatric TB on a regional, national, or global level, thus facilitating the appropriate targeting of health resources and also guiding policy-making decisions."

The potential benefits of delivering TPT to MDR/RR-TB contacts extend beyond the outcomes that clinical trials can measure. We developed an agent-based, household-structured TB and MDR/RR-TB transmission model, calibrated to an illustrative setting in India. We simulated contact investigation in households of patients with MDR/RR-TB, comparing an MDR/RR-TPT regimen (assuming 6-month duration, 70% efficacy) and associated active case finding against alternatives of contact investigation without TPT or no household intervention. We simulated the TB and MDR/RR-TB incidence averted relative to placebo over 2 years, as measurable by a typical trial, as well as the incidence averted over a longer time horizon, in the broader population, and relative to no contact investigation. Observing TPT and placebo recipients for 2 years as in a typical trial, MDR/RR-TPT was measured to prevent 72% (interquartile range, 45%-100%) of incident MDR/RR-TB among recipients; the median number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 MDR/RR-TB case was 73, compared to placebo. This NNT decreased to 54 with 13-18 years of observation, to 27 when downstream transmission effects were also considered, and to 12 when the effects of active TB screening were included by comparing to a no-household-contact-intervention scenario. If forthcoming trial results demonstrate efficacy, the long-term population impact of TPT for MDR/RR-TB-including the large effect of increased active TB detection among MDR/RR-TB contacts-could be much greater than suggested by trial outcomes alone."

In the absence of an effective vaccine, there is an urgent need for new treatment regimens, drugs, and diagnostics to slow the evolution of drug resistance and limit transmission of resistant variants, as well as to ameliorate the treatment outcome of patients infected with MDR/XDR M. tuberculosis strains. To evaluate the efficacy of a shorter drug regimen in MDR-PTB and estimate the adverse effects of drugs used in the regimen. This is an institution-based prospective study which included 135 confirmed MDR-PTB patients. Patients with extra-pulmonary MDR-TB and use of SLI for more than one month were excluded. The success rate using a shorter regimen was 65.2% which is respectable, given the COVID-19 pandemic considered during the study period. Minor adverse events such as nausea (39.3%) and vomiting (34.8%) were reported. Rare adverse effects such as hearing loss (8.9%) and hypothyroidism (0.2%) were also seen in the study population. Overall treatment success was similar when compared to other studies done previously. A shorter drug regimen was associated with minor adverse effects such as gastrointestinal adverse effects such as vomiting and hearing loss observed in elderly patients. Baseline unknown drug resistance and lower BMI were associated with unsuccessful outcomes. Measures should be taken to improve nutrition. Our results argue the need for improving baseline DST at peripheral areas in order to effectively evaluate resistance to other drugs, especially in settings with high levels of first and second-line drug resistance."

Identifying GN transmission patterns is vital to inform preventive efforts. We conducted a prospective cohort study, 12 October 2018 to 31 October 2019 to describe the association of maternal and environmental GN colonization with bloodstream infection (BSI) among neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Western India. We assessed rectal and vaginal colonization in pregnant women presenting for delivery and colonization in neonates and the environment using culture-based methods. We also collected data on BSI for all NICU patients, including neonates born to unenrolled mothers. Organism identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed to compare BSI and related colonization isolates. Among 952 enrolled women who delivered, 257 neonates required NICU admission, and 24 (9.3%) developed BSI. Among mothers of neonates with GN BSI (n = 21), 10 (47.7%) had rectal, 5 (23.8%) had vaginal, and 10 (47.7%) had no colonization with resistant GN organisms. No maternal isolates matched the species and resistance pattern of associated neonatal BSI isolates. Thirty GN BSI were observed among neonates born to unenrolled mothers. Among 37 of 51 BSI with available NGS data, 21 (57%) showed a single nucleotide polymorphism distance of ≤5 to another BSI isolate. Prospective assessment of maternal GN colonization did not demonstrate linkage to neonatal BSI. Organism-relatedness among neonates with BSI suggests nosocomial spread, highlighting the importance of NICU infection prevention and control practices to reduce GN BSI."

Although the available data suggest that the total TB incidence has declined, the absolute number of new cases is still increasing. The number of reported TB cases in India in 2018 was 2.2 million, which was 1.5 million in 2009. About 47% increment in TB case notification in India within a decade shows a persistent public health problem. India contributes about 22% of the World's TB burden. Indian National Strategic Plan 2017-2025, sets out the government plans to eliminate TB by 2025. However, the milestone seems unrealistic to achieve the TB eradication goal by 2025. We developed a five-dimensional mathematical model to understand the TB dynamics in India and investigate the possibility of the earliest TB eradication time frame. The model stratifies the entire TB class into three different classes as drug-sensitive (DS), MDR, and isolated classes. The effective reproduction number, equilibrium points, and stability analysis of the model were carried out. This model predicts the total estimated cases of DS-TB and MDR-TB from 2018 to 2035 through numerical simulation and suggests that TB may be eliminated by 2035 in India if the treatment success rate could be achieved to 95%, by contact tracing and isolating at least 50% of MDR-TB."

We used a Markov model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of three regimens containing bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid (BPaL) with and without moxifloxacin (BPaLM) or clofazimine (BPaLC) compared with the current mix of long and short standard of care (SOC) regimens to treat RR-TB from the provider perspective in India, Georgia, Philippines, and South Africa. We estimated total costs (2019 USD) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) over a 20-year time horizon. Costs and DALYs were discounted at 3% in the base case. Parameter uncertainty was tested with univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We found that all three regimens would improve health outcomes and reduce costs compared with the current programmatic mix of long and short SOC regimens in all four countries. BPaL was the most cost-saving regimen in all countries, saving $112-$1,173 per person. BPaLM was the preferred regimen at a willingness to pay per DALY of 0.5 GDP per capita in all settings. Our findings indicate BPaL-based regimens are likely to be cost-saving and more effective than the current standard of care in a range of settings. Countries should consider programmatic uptake of BPaL-based regimens."

A total of 31,196 studies were registered in CTRI, with 180 studies (0.58%) being related to tuberculosis. Of these studies, 76 (42.2%) were interventional in nature. These consisted of evaluating different management or treatment TB (50%, n = 90), diagnostic studies (19.4%, n = 35) and studies related to screening and prevention of TB (7.8%, n = 14). Maximum studies were conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of anti-TB drugs (10%, n = 18) and to evaluate efficacy of shortening of duration of treatment (8.9%, n = 16). The studies related to extra pulmonary TB, MDR TB and TB in special populations and sources of funding and locations of the study sites were also analysed. These indicate that only minimal TB-related researches are conducted in India. It is indispensable to promote tuberculosis research in India in order to eradicate this infectious disease."

36272707,Whole-genome sequencing of presumptive MDR-TB isolates from a tertiary healthcare setting in Mumbai.,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2022,Zade A; Shah S; Hirani N; Kondabagil K; Joshi A; Chatterjee A,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), proven to be a better alternative when compared with the combined sensitivity and specificity of all other modalities for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), aids epidemiological surveillance investigations by combining the current research with diagnostics. This study was conducted to identify and resolve operational challenges in performing WGS-based drug resistance testing (DRT) for MTB in a TB culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) laboratory. Three critical, non-redundant steps for WGS-based DRT were tested: viz. DNA extraction, high-throughput paired-end next-generation sequencing (NGS), and genomic analysis pipeline for automated reporting of WGS-based DRT. DNA was extracted from 100 liquid culture isolates on a mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) using DNEASY Ultraclean Microbial Kit (Qiagen, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Illumina paired-end sequencing was performed. All analysis steps were automated using custom python scripts, requiring no intervention. Variant calling was performed as per the World Health Organization (WHO) technical guide. The number of cultures resistant to rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin was 89, 88, 35, 67, and 73, respectively. Resistance to amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin was found in 15, 17, and 15 cultures, respectively. Seventy cultures were resistant to fluoroquinolones, four were resistant to ethionamide, and 12 were resistant to linezolid. Six cultures were resistant to only one of the 18 drugs tested. Seventy-five cultures were resistant to more than three anti-TB drugs. One culture was resistant to 13 of the 18 anti-TB drugs tested for this study. The maximum number of variants were observed in the rpoB gene (n = 93, 93%), wherein the Ser450Leu was the predominant mutation (n = 68, 73%). Ser315Thr was the most common variant (n = 86, 97%) that encoded resistance to isoniazid. The Lys43Arg variant encodes resistance to streptomycin and was the third most predominant variant (n = 65, 89%). In addition to the high levels of resistance observed in the dataset, we also observed a high proportion of Beijing strains (n = 63, 63%). Compared with results from routine diagnostics based on the 'Guidelines on Programmatic Management of Drug-Resistant TB (PMDT) in India', none of the samples had DST available for all 18 drugs. This represents a gap in PMDT guidelines. The WGS-DRT must be considered as the primary DST method after a sample is flagged rifampicin-resistant by cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification testing (CBNAAT). With several research studies currently underway globally to identify novel variants associated with drug resistance and classifiy their minimum inhibitory coefficients, WGS-DRT presents a scalable technology that updates analytical pipelines, relegating the need for changing microbiological protocols."
36200688,Factors affecting the treatment outcome of injection based shorter MDR-TB regimen at a referral centre in India.,Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,2022,B K; Singla R; Singla N; V V; Singh K; Choudhury MP; Bhattacherjee N,"Rifampicin-resistant/multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB) is a significant burden on global tuberculosis (TB) prevention and eradication efforts. MDR-TB can be treated, but it is expensive, takes a long time (typically two years) and contains potentially toxic drugs. Under certain conditions, the WHO recommends standard regimens lasting 9 to 11 months rather than individual regimens lasting at least 18-20 months. The current study sought to identify factors associated with treatment outcomes in RR/MDR-TB patients receiving an injection-based regimen for 9-11 months. This ambispective (prospective and retrospective) observational study was conducted at a tertiary tuberculosis institute in New Delhi, India. Between February 2021 and March 2022, patients with RR/MDR-pulmonary TB who received an injection-based shorter regimen were enrolled. Factors related to treatment outcomes were investigated and compared in patients who had a successful outcome versus those who did not. A total of 55 patients were enrolled, with 50.91% being successful (cured/treatment completed) and 49.09% failing (including failure, lost to follow up, death, and regimen change). The following factors were significantly associated with the unsuccessful outcome, according to univariate analysis: BMI (<18.5 kg/m2), anaemia, previous anti-TB treatment, bilateral chest X-ray involvement, and far advanced disease on chest X-ray. BMI (<18.5 kg/m2), anaemia, and far advanced disease on chest X-ray were all significantly associated with mortality. Anaemia was associated with an unsuccessful outcome (p=0.049) and mortality (p=0.048) in the multiple logistic regression analysis. Early treatment initiation, improved nutrition and anaemia, and regular monitoring can all improve RR/MDR-TB patients' outcomes and prognoses."
35989319,High fluoroquinolone resistance proportions among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis driven by dominant L2 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clones in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.,Genome medicine,2022,Dreyer V; Mandal A; Dev P; Merker M; Barilar I; Utpatel C; Nilgiriwala K; Rodrigues C; Crook DW; CRyPTIC Consortium; Rasigade JP; Wirth T; Mistry N; Niemann S,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains are a serious health problem in India, also contributing to one-fourth of the global MDR tuberculosis (TB) burden. About 36% of the MDR MTBC strains are reported fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistant leading to high pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR) and XDR-TB (further resistance against bedaquiline and/or linezolid) rates. Still, factors driving the MDR/pre-XDR epidemic in India are not well defined. In a retrospective study, we analyzed 1852 consecutive MTBC strains obtained from patients from a tertiary care hospital laboratory in Mumbai by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Univariate and multivariate statistics was used to investigate factors associated with pre-XDR. Core genome multi locus sequence typing, time scaled haplotypic density (THD) method and homoplasy analysis were used to analyze epidemiological success, and positive selection in different strain groups, respectively. In total, 1016 MTBC strains were MDR, out of which 703 (69.2%) were pre-XDR and 45 (4.4%) were XDR. Cluster rates were high among MDR (57.8%) and pre-XDR/XDR (79%) strains with three dominant L2 (Beijing) strain clusters (Cl 1-3) representing half of the pre-XDR and 40% of the XDR-TB cases. L2 strains were associated with pre-XDR/XDR-TB (P < 0.001) and, particularly Cl 1-3 strains, had high first-line and FQ resistance rates (81.6-90.6%). Epidemic success analysis using THD showed that L2 strains outperformed L1, L3, and L4 strains in short- and long-term time scales. More importantly, L2 MDR and MDR + strains had higher THD success indices than their not-MDR counterparts. Overall, compensatory mutation rates were highest in L2 strains and positive selection was detected in genes of L2 strains associated with drug tolerance (prpB and ppsA) and virulence (Rv2828c). Compensatory mutations in L2 strains were associated with a threefold increase of THD indices, suggesting improved transmissibility. Our data indicate a drastic increase of FQ resistance, as well as emerging bedaquiline resistance which endangers the success of newly endorsed MDR-TB treatment regimens. Rapid changes in treatment and control strategies are required to contain transmission of highly successful pre-XDR L2 strains in the Mumbai Metropolitan region but presumably also India-wide."

India is among the countries with high MDR-TB burden. Currently, sputum smear microscopy using Ziehl Neelsen stain and GeneXpert are the only diagnostic means in Mizoram. This study was done to characterize local tuberculosis strains circulating in Mizoram. Sputum was cultured using MGIT 960 and DST was performed for Streptomycin, Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. GeneXpert test was done simultaneously. DNA was extracted using Trueprep AUTO v2, molbio diagnostics. Antibiotic Resistance Genes and LSP were amplified and sequenced. Ser315Thr was the most common mutation in katG among MDR-TB isolates. GeneXpert probes A and D drop out upon sequencing showed L511P, H526Q and H526L mutation. The L511P and H526Q mutations were seen in new and treated cases. Discrepancy between MGIT 960 and GeneXpert were observed. LSP-PCR revealed that Indo-Oceanic, East-African Indian, Euro-American and Beijing lineages were found in Mizoram. This study provides mutation information on the resistant genotypes detected with GeneXpert as well as MGIT 960. It also provides information on the lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis circulating in the state. Utilization of sequencing technologies is essential in diagnostic laboratories to rule out discrepant results and as a cautionary measure to prevent wrong diagnosis and treatment."

In this study, we aimed to find the quality of MDRTB on various quality of life domains during the initiation of the MDR Treatment regimen. A cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 6 months at the Drug-Resistance Tuberculosis Management Centre (DR-TB Centre), of a tertiary care centre in the eastern Uttar pradesh, India. Patients with age >18 years diagnosed with MDR-TB (Multidrug resistance TB) were included in the study. The WHO QOL-BREF scale was used to assess the health-related quality of life of patients. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. The institutional ethical review committee approved the study, and consent was taken before the participation of patients. A total of 157 patients were included in the study & 45.85% were dissatisfied with their condition. Social domain of WHO QOL-BREF is having the lowest mean score (28.51 ± 15.4) while psychological has high mean values (39.92 ± 6.91). There was a significant difference in the physical health domain with respect to age (p-value 0.001). Similar differences have been seen in the psychological domain regarding patient sex (p-value 0.001), smoking and alcohol within the social domain, and loss of income in the environmental domain. The mean value of different domains of WHO QOL-BREF is low in MDR-TB patients, with social relation domain being the most affected."

Multi-drug resistant (MDR-TB) is seen as the reason for many TB outbreaks globally and is also a threat to control programmes. India accounts for 27% TB cases worldwide. Our study was undertaken to understand the outbreaks related to MTB. All the sputum samples were subjected to microscopy and smear positive samples were cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) media. Identification was carried by biochemical analysis. A total of 57 isolates were subjected to Drug Susceptibility testing (DST) and spoligotyping, where eleven MDR-TB isolates were confirmed, of which ten were SIT1/Beijing and one SIT53/T1. Spoligotyping results showed that the predominant lineage in this region was SIT1/Beijing followed by SIT124/U and the strains which did not match spoligodatabase were named as orphans. In this study, MDR-TB was associated with SIT1/Beijing and mono resistance belonged to CAS1_DEL."

In the Jodhpur district, 150 confirmed pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases, diagnosed by probe-based molecular drug susceptibility testing method and categorized as MDR in DTC's register (District Tuberculosis Center), were taken. Simultaneously, 300 control of confirmed non-MDR or drug-sensitive pulmonary TB patients were taken. Statistical analysis was done with logistic regression. In addition, for spatial analysis, secondary data from 2013-17 was analyzed using Global Moran's I and Getis and Ordi (Gi*) statistics. In 2012-18, a total of 12563 CBNAAT (Cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) were performed. 2898 (23%) showed M. TB positive but rifampicin sensitive, and 590 (4.7%) showed rifampicin resistant. Independent risk factors for MDR TB were ≤60 years age (AOR 3.0, CI 1.3-7.1); male gender (AOR 3.4, CI 1.8-6.7); overcrowding (AOR 1.6, CI 1.0-2.7); using chulha (smoke appliance) for cooking (AOR 2.5, CI 1.2-4.9), past TB treatment (AOR 5.7, CI 2.9-11.3) and past contact with MDR patient (AOR 10.7, CI 3.7-31.2). All four urban TUs (Tuberculosis Units) had the highest proportion of drug-resistant pulmonary TB. There was no statistically significant clustering, and the pattern of cases was primarily random. Most of the hotspots generated were present near the administrative boundaries of TUs, and the new ones mostly appeared in the area near the previous hotspots. A random pattern seen in cluster analysis supports the universal drug testing policy of India. Hotspot analysis helps cross administrative border initiatives with targeted active case finding and proper follow-up."
34752317,Drug resistance pattern and mutation pattern in pediatric tuberculosis: Study from north India.,The Indian journal of tuberculosis,2021,Khurana P; Saigal K; Ghosh A,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant XDR-TB are serious threats to global TB control. Molecular tests like GenoType MTBDRplus has revolutionized MDR-TB diagnosis by rapid detection of resistance, leading to early and appropriate management of DR-TB. Information about common mutations imparting resistance to RIF and INH, helps in understanding the disease epidemiology in various regions. The study was conducted to determine the genetic mutation in drug resistant tuberculosis in children less than 12 years with pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Retrospective analysis was done over a period of 54 months from January 2015 to June 2019 to study the resistance pattern and mutations present in DR-TB in children less than 12 years with suspected pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis using Hain's GenoType MTBDRplus VER 2.0. Over a period of 54 months, samples from 3461 patients with suspected TB were received for MGIT culture, out of which, 347 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 250 of these 347 isolated were tested for drug resistance by Hain's GenoType MTBDRplus VER 2.0.61.1% were sensitive to isoniazid and rifampicin while 15.2% were DR-TB (38 out of 250). Out of these 38, 22 were MDR TB, 13 were isoniazid monoresistant (34.2%) and 3 were rifampicin monoresistant. The most common genotypic resistance for rifampicin was absence of rpoB WT8 band and presence of rpoB MUT 3 band (88%). 84.6% of the INH monoresistant isolates showed high level isoniazid resistant. All these isolates showed presence of katG MUT 1 band. On comparing Hain's GenoType MTBDRplus VER 2.0 with Xpert MTB/Rif Assay, most common mutation for rifampicin resistance at S531L which can be detected by Xpert MTB/Rif Assay (probe E). However, two cases with rifampicin resistance had mutation in codon region 509-513 and 513-519 which could be missed by Xpert MTB/Rif Assay. We cannot solely rely on Xpert MTB/Rif Assay for detection of drug resistance due to the risk of missing the isoniazid monoresistance. GenoType MTBDRplus has revolutionized MDR-TB diagnosis by substantially reducing turn around time and leading to early management of DR-TB cases."

Multidrug resistant (MDR-TB) and Extensive drug resistant (XDR-TB) tuberculosis are the common type of DR-TB. Psychological issues like depression and anxiety are common among the chronic illnesses like tuberculosis. This study aimed at estimating the prevalence of depression and anxiety among these patients. Our study is conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India. This study aimed at identifying the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the drug resistant tuberculosis patients attending DOTS clinic. The depression and anxiety were screened using PHQ-9 and HAM-A inventories. Binomial and multinomial regression analysis were done to identifying the predictors of depression and anxiety. The prevalence rate of depression in MDR-TB and XDR-TB is 68% and 78% respectively. The prevalence of anxiety is 54% in MDR-TB and 66% in XDR-TB respectively in our study. Duration of illness and literacy were the significant predictors of depression and anxiety. Patients with DR-TB faces huge psychological burden and this study highlighted the toll of depression and anxiety among them. Adequate screening, identification and treatment for these disorders among DR-TB patients at their earlier treatment stage helps in improving the adherence to treatment and functionality."

Despite their large presence, there are only a few reports available on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) strain prevalence in Indian tribal communities considering the mobile nature of this population and also the influence of the mainstream populations they coexist within many areas for their livelihood. This study attempts to provide critical information pertaining to the TB strain diversity, its public health implications, and distribution among the tribal population in eleven Indian states and Andaman & Nicobar (A&N) Island. The study employed a population-based molecular approach. Clinical isolates were received from 66 villages (10 states and Island) and these villages were selected by implying situation analysis. A total of 78 M. tb clinical isolates were received from 10 different states and A&N Island. Among these, 16 different strains were observed by spoligotyping technique. The major M. tb strains spoligotype belong to the Beijing, CAS1_DELHI, and EAI5 family of M. tb strains followed by EAI1_SOM, EAI6_BGD1, LAM3, LAM6, LAM9, T1, T2, U strains. Drug-susceptibility testing (DST) results showed almost 15.4% of clinical isolates found to be resistant to isoniazid (INH) or rifampicin (RMP) + INH. Predominant multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) isolates seem to be Beijing strain. Beijing, CAS1_DELHI, EAI3_IND, and EAI5 were the principal strains infecting mixed tribal populations across India. Despite the small sample size, this study has demonstrated higher diversity among the TB strains with significant MDR-TB findings. Prevalence of Beijing MDR-TB strains in Central, Southern, Eastern India and A&N Island indicates the transmission of the TB strains."

Annually, about half a million people fall ill with DR-TB globally. The gradual increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs), poses a serious threat to effective TB control and adequate patient management. Therefore, WHO suggests the use of GenoType MTBDRsl v.2.0 assay for detection of multiple mutations associated with FQs and SLIDs. Hence, the study was conducted to determine the prevalence of resistance to FQs and SLIDs by comparing direct GenoType MTBDRsl v.2.0 assay with phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). The study was conducted on 1320 smear positive sputum samples from a total of 2536 RR-TB, confirmed by GeneXpert MTB/RIF. The smear positive specimens were decontaminated, and DNA extraction was performed. Furthermore, the extracted DNA was used for GenoType MTBDRsl v.2.0 assay. While 20% of the decontaminated specimens were inoculated in Mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) for drug susceptibility testing (DST). Out of 1320 smear positive sputum samples, 1178 were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and remaining were negative by GenoType MTBDRsl v.2.0 assay. Of the 1178 MTBC positive, 26.6% were sensitive to both FQs and SLIDs, whereas 57.3% were only FQs resistant and 15.9% were resistant to both FQs and SLIDs. Further DST of 225 isolates by liquid culture showed that 17% were sensitive to both FQs and SLIDs, 61.3% were only FQs resistant and 21.3% were resistant to both. The specificity for FQs and SLIDs was 92.31% and 100% whereas sensitivity was 100% respectively by GenoType MTBDRsl v.2.0 assay in direct sputum samples. Our study clearly suggests that GenoType MTBDRsl v.2.0 assay is a reliable test for the rapid detection of resistance to second-line drugs after confirmation by GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay for RR-TB. Though, high rate FQ (ofloxacin) resistance was seen in our setting, moxifloxacin could be used as treatment option owing to very low resistance."

Spinal tuberculosis accounts for about 50% of cases among extra pulmonary osteoarticular tuberculosis. Resistance to drugs in spinal tuberculosis patients is on a rise and there is inadequate literature concentrating on the precise pattern of resistance in Indian subcontinent which harbors 24% of global prevalence. The aim was to study the pattern of drug resistance in spinal tuberculosis among first- and second-line drugs. Drug resistance is common in spinal tuberculosis and we intended to find the prevalence of various drug resistance patterns. Patients with spinal tuberculosis visiting a tertiary center were assessed. Samples were taken from the affected vertebrae and sent for BACTEC mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) 960 culture. Patients with a positive growth in MGIT were included in the study. All previously treated patients (relapse, treatment after failure, treatment after loss to follow-up and other previously treated patients) were excluded. A total of 150 patients with a positive growth in MGIT report were included in the study, of whom 43 patients had some kind of drug resistance. Seven were multidrug resistant (MDR), 9 had preextensive drug resistance (pre-XDR), and 4 had extensive drug resistance (XDR). Seventeen patients had mono-drug resistance, which was most frequently for isoniazid. Resistance among second-line drugs was common in the fluoroquinolone group. Drug resistance in spinal tuberculosis was found to be 28.6%. Of these, MDR was in 16.2%, pre-XDR in 20.9%, and XDR in 9.3% patients."

We investigated the epidemiologic impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of hypothetical novel prophylactic prevention of disease TB vaccines on RR/MDR-TB in China and India. We constructed a deterministic, compartmental, age-, drug-resistance- and treatment history-stratified dynamic transmission model of tuberculosis. We introduced novel vaccines from 2027, with post- (PSI) or both pre- and post-infection (P&PI) efficacy, conferring 10 years of protection, with 50% efficacy. We measured vaccine cost-effectiveness over 2027-2050 as USD/DALY averted-against 1-times GDP/capita, and two healthcare opportunity cost-based (HCOC), thresholds. We carried out scenario analyses. By 2050, the P&PI vaccine reduced RR/MDR-TB incidence rate by 71% (UI: 69-72) and 72% (UI: 70-74), and the PSI vaccine by 31% (UI: 30-32) and 44% (UI: 42-47) in China and India, respectively. In India, we found both USD 10 P&PI and PSI vaccines cost-effective at the 1-times GDP and upper HCOC thresholds and P&PI vaccines cost-effective at the lower HCOC threshold. In China, both vaccines were cost-effective at the 1-times GDP threshold. P&PI vaccine remained cost-effective at the lower HCOC threshold with 49% probability and PSI vaccines at the upper HCOC threshold with 21% probability. The P&PI vaccine was predicted to avert 0.9 million (UI: 0.8-1.1) and 1.1 million (UI: 0.9-1.4) second-line therapy regimens in China and India between 2027 and 2050, respectively. Novel TB vaccination is likely to substantially reduce the future burden of RR/MDR-TB, while averting the need for second-line therapy. Vaccination may be cost-effective depending on vaccine characteristics and setting."

Children below 10 years had higher proportion of successful treatment outcomes (94% versus 60%) compared to adolescents. Patients with undernutrition [adjusted odds-ratio, aOR (95% Confidence Interval, 95%CI): 2.5 (1.3-4.8) or those with XDR-TB [aOR (95% CI): 4.3 (1.3-13.8)] had higher likelihood of having unsuccessful DR-TB treatment outcome. High proportion of successful treatment outcome was reported, better than global reports. Further, the nutritional support and routine treatment follow up should be strengthened. All oral short and long regimens including systematic use of new TB drugs (Bedaquiline and Delamanid) should be rapidly scaled up in routine TB programme, especially for the paediatric and adolescent population."

We aimed to find out the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and predictors for discontinuation of MDR-TB regimens. We conducted this cross-sectional study in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat from September to November 2016 through home visits and personal interviews of 94 patients with MDR-TB. Sixty-nine patients with MDR-TB (73%) reported ADRs. Tingling (42.6%), headache (37.2%), numbness (36.2%), dizziness (34%) and nausea (33%) were the most common ADRs. Of the 94 patients, 7.4% were compelled to think of discontinuing their treatment due to ADRs; 8.5% had discontinued Cat-I/Cat-II regimen in the past; 11.7% had discontinued their MDR-TB regimen in the past; 13.8% had their drug regimen changed due to ADRs and 94.7% had good adherence to their current regimen (took at least 80% of their doses till date). ADRs were the reason for 75% of the patients who discontinued their Cat-I/Cat-II regimen in the past and 64% of the patients who discontinued their MDR-TB regimen in the past. Tobacco chewing, poor adherence and thought of discontinuing an MDR-TB regimen due to ADRs were significant predictors for discontinuation on bivariate analysis. On multiple logistic regression, none of the predictors were significant. The frequency of ADRs among patients with MDR-TB is high. ADRs were the primary reason for discontinuing MDR-TB drugs."
33308655,Genital tb-diagnostic algorithm and treatment.,The Indian journal of tuberculosis,2020,Sharma JB; Sharma E; Sharma S; Singh J; Chopra N,"Female genital tuberculosis (FGTB) is a common cause of infertility in India but its diagnosis remains elusive due to paucibacillary nature of disease. Traditional methods of diagnosis include demonstration of acid fast bacilli on endometrial or peritoneal biopsy or epithelioid granuloma on the biopsy or positive gene Xpert on the biopsy, but they are positive in small percentage of cases only missing diagnosis in many cases. Positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) alone is not taken for diagnosis due to high false positivity. Diagnostic laparoscopy and hysteroscopy can detect many cases by direct demonstration of TB lesions. Composite reference standard is a useful method to diagnose FGTB. This review discusses various diagnostic modalities including endometrial or peritoneal biopsy to detect acid fast bacilli on microscopic or culture or epithelioid granuloma, role of PCR, role of radiological imaging (hysterosalpingography, ultrasound, CT scan, MRI and PET-CT scan) and role of endoscopic techniques (laparoscopy and hysteroscopy) in diagnosis of FGTB including role of composite reference standard. The International and National studies highlight the role of composite reference standard and its components like demonstration of AFB on microscopy or culture of endometrial or peritoneal biopsy or epithelioid granuloma or gene Xpert or PCR or latest tests like loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TB-LAMP) test and other newer molecular methods like Xpert Ultra for diagnosis of FGTB. It also detects role of endoscopy in FGTB and role of diagnostic algorithm for diagnosis of FGTB. Treatment is with four primary drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) for two months followed by three drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol) daily orally for 4 months for drug sensitive FGTB. Shorter Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) regimen is given for Rifampicin resistant (RR)/MDR confined to only FGTB while longer all oral regimen is given for RR/MDR with or without additional drug resistance, HIV seropositives with FGTB or involvement of other sites or pulmonary TB (PTB) along with FGTB. Composite reference standard which combines various diagnostic modalities is a useful strategy to diagnose FGTB."

Novel and potentially cost-effective therapies such as vitamin D supplementation are needed to stem the tide of TB and MDR-TB globally, particularly in India, a country that accounts for the largest fraction of the world's TB incidence and MDR-TB incidence, and where vitamin D deficiency is endemic. While vitamin D has shown some promise in the treatment of MDR-TB, its role in the context of MDR-TB infection and progression to disease is largely unknown. Through a case-control study in Mumbai, India, we aim to examine associations between vitamin D status and active MDR-TB and to investigate vitamin D status and TB infection among controls. Cases are adult outpatient pulmonary patients with MDR-TB recruited from two public TB clinics. Controls are recruited from the cases' household contacts and from non-respiratory departments of the facilities where cases were recruited. Cases and controls are assessed for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, nutrient intake, diet quality, anthropometry and other relevant clinical and sociodemographic parameters. Controls undergo additional clinical assessments to rule out active TB and laboratory assessments to determine presence of TB infection. Statistical analysis investigates associations between vitamin D status and active MDR-TB and between vitamin D status and TB infection among controls, accounting for potential confounding effects of diet, anthropometry and other covariates.

These delays have been attributed to delay in treatment-seeking by the patient and shifting to multiple healthcare facilities before being tested and diagnosed through India's National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP). to identify treatment pathways in patients with MDR-TB from the time of onset of symptoms and treatment seeking until diagnosis at a PMDT site and subsequent treatment initiation. We also compared these characteristics with those of patients with DS-TB. We recruited a total of 168 patients with MDR-TB and DS-TB each, in Delhi. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Version 25. The mean (SD) patient delay for initial treatment-seeking was 20.9 (15.9) days in patients with MDR-TB, and 16.1 (17.1) days in patients with DS-TB (p < 0.001). The median time from visit to the first healthcare facility (HCF) until confirmation of MDR-TB diagnosis was 78.5 days, and until treatment initiation was 102.5 days. Among patients with DS-TB, the time interval from a visit to the first HCF until the initiation of ATT-DOTS was 61.5 days.. Patients diagnosed with DS-TB, whose first source of treatment was a private facility (n = 49), reported a significant delay in the initiation of ATT-DOTS (p < 0.001). Despite the introduction of universal drug sensitivity testing in individuals having presumptive MDR-TB, a significant delay in the diagnosis and initiation of effective MDR-TB treatment persists as a major public health challenge in India."

This study aims to assess  the prevalence and factors associated with tuberculosis drug resistance among patients from South India. MTBDRplus assay and MGIT liquid culture performed on 20,245 sputum specimens obtained from presumptive MDR-TB cases during a six-year period from 2013 to 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to evaluate factors associated with MDR, Rifampicin mono-resistance, and Isoniazid mono-resistance. MDR, Rifampicin mono- resistant and Isoniazid mono-resistant TB were  found in 5.4%, 2.5%, and 11.4% cases of presumptive MDR-TB, respectively. Based on the rpoB gene, true resistance, hetero-resistance, and inferred resistance to Rifampicin was found in 38%, 29.3%, and 32.7% of the 1582 MDR cases, respectively. S450L (MUT3) was the most common rpoB mutation present in 59.4% of the Rifampicin resistant cases. Of the 3390 Isoniazid resistant cases, 72.5% had mutations in the katG gene, and 27.5% had mutations in the inhA gene. True resistance, heteroresistance, and inferred resistance accounted for 42.9%, 22.2%, and 17.3% of the 2459 katG resistant cases, respectively. True resistance, heteroresistance, and inferred resistance for the inhA gene were found in 54.5%, 40.7%, and 4.7% cases, respectively. MDR-contact (AOR 3.171 95% CI: 1.747-5.754, p-0.000) treatment failure (AOR 2.17595% CI: 1.703-2.777, p-0.000) and female gender (AOR 1.315 95% CI: 1.117-1.548, p-0.001), were positively associated with MDR-TB. Previous TB treatment did not show a significant positive association with MDR (AOR 1.113 95% CI: 0.801-1.546, p-0.523). Old age (AOR 0.994 95% CI: 0.990-0.999, p-0.023) and HIV seropositivity (AOR 0.580 95% CI: 0.369-0.911, p-0.018) were negatively associated with MDR-TB. Although Rifampicin mono-resistance had a positive association with treatment failure (AOR 2.509 95% CI: 1.804-3.490, p < .001), it did not show any association with previous TB treatment (AOR 1.286 95% CI: 0.765-2.164, p-0.342) or with history of contact with MDR-TB (AOR 1.813 95% CI: 0.591-5.560, p-0.298). However, INH mono-resistance showed a small positive association with the previous history of treatment for TB (AOR 1.303 95% CI: 1.021-1.662, p-0.033). It was also positively associated (AOR 2.094 95% CI: 1.236-3.548, p-0.006) with MDR-TB contacts. Thus INH resistance may develop during treatment if compliance has not adhered too and may be easily passed on to the contacts while Rifampicin resistance is probably due to factors other than treatment compliance. MDR-TB, i.e. resistance to both Rifampicin and Isoniazid, is strongly correlated with treatment failure, spread through contact, and not to treatment compliance. The temporal trend in this region shows a decrease in MDR prevalence from 8.4% in 2015 to 1.3% in 2018. A similar trend is observed for Rifampicin mono-resistance and Isoniazid mono-resistance, pointing to the effectiveness of the TB control program. The higher proportion of inferred resistance observed for Rifampicin compared with INH may indicate a surfeit of mechanisms that enable rifampicin resistance. Association of MDR-TB with age, gender, and HIV status suggest the role of the immune system in the emergence of the MDR phenotype."

Among them, the most promising antibiotic regimens are fluoroquinolone (FQ) drugs. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) for FQs is not included as routine assessment for baseline TB diagnosis. Limited resources are available about FQ resistance among extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases. A total of 447 culture-positive specimens were subjected to DST for first-line anti-TB drugs (FLDs) and second-line anti-TB drugs. DST was performed using automated mycobacterium growth indicator tube-960 liquid culture techniques. The study was carried out during the period of April 2016 to March 2017. In addition, DST of FQs was also performed in FLD-sensitive strains. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated from 447 specimens. Of the 447 culture-positive EPTB specimens, 54 were rifampicin-resistant (RR)/multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) isolates, 45 isolates were resistant to any drug, and the remaining 348 were sensitive to FLDs. Monoresistance of FQs was observed in 20.4% (11/54) among RR/MDR-TB isolates and 4.3% (15/348) among FLD-sensitive isolates. The high degree of FQ resistance observed in EPTB specimens among drug-sensitive and MDR-TB isolates is alarming. This study reflects the need to expand culture and DST for EPTB cases and include FQs within first-line DST in such settings. Furthermore, there should be a rational use of FQs for the treatment of other diseases."

A retrospective record-based study (2009-2014) was conducted in three major drug resistance TB treatment centres of Delhi. Treatment outcomes and adverse effects were extracted from the existing programme records including patients' treatment cards and laboratory registers. A total of 2958 MDR-TB patients were identified from the treatment cards, of whom 1749 (59.12%) were males. The mean (±standard deviation) age was 30.56±13.5 years. Favourable treatment outcomes were reported in 1371 (53.28%) patients, but they showed a declining trend during the period of observation. On binomial logistic regression analysis, patients with age ≥35 yr, male sex and undernourishment (body mass index <18.5) at the time of treatment initiation had a significantly increased likelihood of unfavourable MDR-TB treatment outcome (P <0.001). The study showed an increasing burden of MDR-TB patients, especially in the young population with increased risk of transmission posing a major challenge in achieving TB elimination targets."

India constitutes one-fourth of the global TB population. The emerging drug resistance is a major threat to global tuberculosis care and control. We present a case of newly diagnosed microbiologically confirmed, extremely drugresistant primary pulmonary tuberculosis which was treated with Delamanid and was found to be cured of tuberculosis. Delamanid is a new anti-tubercular drug, which is thought to primarily inhibit the synthesis of methoxy-mycolic, and keto-mycolic acid, which are components of the mycobacterial cell wall. In our patient who was a newly diagnosed case of MDR-TB converted to XDR-TB in little course of time and we were successful in treating him with Delamanid therapy. His sputum culture conversion was achieved in 20 days. Even though the patient did not tolerate well because of the side effects of the drug, still he became microbiologically negative for tuberculosis. Delamanid fulfills many target criteria for new TB drugs and may be particularly useful for the treatment of MDR-TB. It can be administered orally and its bactericidal properties make it suitable in regimens designed to shorten treatment duration. Clinical efficacy data, while limited, are reassuring."

Studies and reports of drug-resistant mutations and phenotypic assays thus become important. This study was conducted to investigate the molecular characteristics of ofloxacin (OFX)-resistant, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates from different geographical regions of India and their association with strains of different genotypes. Further, the nitrate reductase assay (NRA) was tested against Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube(MGIT) for the determination of OFX resistance as an alternative and cost-effective method. A total of 116 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were used to assess the mutations in the gyrA, gyrB genes and resistance levels to OFX. Mutational analysis in gyrA and gyrB genes and genotype analysis of M. tuberculosis isolates was done by gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by DNA sequencing and spoligotyping, respectively. Three (6.25%), 12 (44.44%) and 12 (29.27%) MDR-TB isolates from western, northern and southern India, respectively, were found to be OFX-resistant MDR-TB isolates. OFX resistance was observed to be significantly higher in MDR-TB cases for all study regions. Beijing genotypes from northern India were observed to be associated with OFX-resistant MDR-TB cases (P <0.05). Among 35 (30.15%) phenotypically OFX-resistant isolates, 22 (62.86%) had mutations in the gyrA gene and two (5.71%) isolates had mutations in the gyrB gene. These results caution against the PCR-based prediction of OFX resistance patterns and highlight the need for searching other genetic loci for the detection of mutations conferring resistance to OFX in M. tuberculosis. Our study also showed the usefulness of NRA as an alternative method to detect OFX resistance."

Taking the example of India, the country with the world's largest burden of TB, we show that adoption of these regimens could be: (i) epidemiologically impactful, and (ii) cost-saving to the national TB programme, even if the regimen itself is more costly than current TB treatment. Mathematical modelling suggests that deployment of a pan-TB regimen in 2022 would reduce the annual incidence of TB in 2030 by 23.9% [95% Bayesian credible intervals [CrI] 17.6-30.8%] if used to treat all TB cases, and by 2.30% [95% CrI 1.57-3.48%] if used to treat only RR-TB. Notably, with a regimen costing less than USD 359 (95% CrI 287-441), treating all diagnosed TB cases with the pan-TB regimen yielded greater cost-savings than treating just those diagnosed with RR-TB. One limitation of our approach is that it does not capture the risk of resistance to the new regimen. We discuss ways in which this risk could be mitigated using modern adherence support mechanisms, as well as drug sensitivity testing at the point of TB diagnosis, to prevent new resistant forms from becoming established. A combination of such approaches would be important for maximising the useful lifetime of any future regimen."

Knowledge on risk-factors and distribution of MDR-TB at district level is limited. Study prevalence and risk factors of MDR-TB in tuberculosis patients in hilly districts of Himachal Pradesh, India. Between July 2012-June 2013, TB patients registered under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program in Kangra and Una districts suspected of MDR-TB were referred for Xpert® MTB/RIF testing at the Delek Hospital, Dharamsala by the district TB Office. Of 378 patients enrolled (median age: 45 years; 85% males), 18% (n = 68) were rifampin-resistant. Among Xpert positives (n = 305), distributions of RR-TB were: 10% (n = 9/89) for recurrent cases who had received TB treatment for <2-months, 15% each for new (n = 9/59) or recurrent cases (n = 5/34) remaining smear positive between 2 and 4 months of treatment, 36% (n = 41/113) for treatment failures, and 40% (n = 2/5) for loss to follow-ups. Of the sputum-smear positives, 15% (n = 51/338) were Xpert negative. Seeking care in the private sector was associated with higher risk of RR-TB (OR:1.85; 95% CI:0.87-3.9). Prevalence of RR-TB is generally high in patients suspected of MDR-TB in the hilly districts of Himachal Pradesh. High prevalence during early phase of treatment can suggest primary transmission of DR-TB. Universal drug susceptibility testing and innovative case finding strategies will benefit patients living in mountain districts with inadequate access to healthcare. The high proportion of sputum-smear positive but Xpert negative cases may be due to non-tubercular mycobacterial disease."

However, in recent years a number of novel mutations are identified that confer resistance. Thus, Genotype MTBDRsl V2.0 was endorsed by WHO. Though, Genotype MTBDRsl V2.0 has been rolled out in national TB programme in 2018, there is dearth of data from India on its performance for second line drug susceptibility testing (DST). For this, performance of new version was evaluated on 113 MDR-TB isolates. The results showed that 39 (34.5%) of these isolates were resistant to FQ and 7 (6.2%) were XDR by Genotype MTBDRsl V2.0. Amongst the FQ resistant isolates most prevalent mutation was ΔWT3-D94G (17; 38.6%) and N538D (12; 85.7%). Among the AG/CP and KAN resistant isolates most common mutation in the rrs region was ΔWT1-A1401G (5; 71.4%) and C-14T (2; 28.5%) in eis gene. Second line Bactec MGIT-960 detected 40 (35.4%) isolates as resistant to FQ and 6 (5.3%) as XDR isolates, whereas Genotype MTBDRsl V1.0 also detected 39 (34.5%) as resistant to FQ but missed 2 isolates in correctly identifying as XDR (5; 4.4%). Thus, concordance of second line Bactec MGIT-960 with Genotype MTBDRsl V2.0 was similar (100%) for FQ detection but it has improvised the diagnostic sensitivity for correctly identifying XDR isolates. Nevertheless, the cost of Genotype MTBDRsl V2.0 remains an issue for screening of second line drug (SLDs) resistance from countries with high burden of MDR-TB."

Recent research suggests that Homeopathic treatment along with the antibiotics synergise the effect of antibiotics while reaching to its site of action. Additionally in Siddha system, formulation of medicinal herbs showing significant activity against TB bacteria. Furthermore, adopting the management or principles of Unani system would be beneficial in health and disease. Similarly, Unani and Naturopathy through natural healing are equally effective. On the other hand, medicinal plants from the Ayurveda that have been successfully employed to treat TB because of less toxicity and side effect in comparison with existing antibiotics. The findings in this review have provided scientific support for anti-TB activity of different medicinal system of India via numerous underlying mechanisms."

This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to synthesize evidence regarding the prevalence of MDR-TB in adult patients in India. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to find different observational studies reporting MDR-TB prevalence in India. Data related to MDR-TB prevalence were pooled for the analysis. PubMed was searched by using different MeSH words. Prevalence was reported with 95% confidence interval (CI). A separate analysis was done for new cases and previously treated cases. Random effect model was used and heterogeneity was assessed by I MDR-TB prevalence in new cases were 3% (95% CI 2%-5%, I MDR-TB prevalence in previously treated patients was found higher compared to the reported values in national surveys. There is a need for large scale cross-sectional study to verify the findings observed in this review."

India accounted for 20 % of world cases. Globally, 3.5 % of new cases and 18% of previously treated cases had MDR-TB. Corresponding figures for India are 2.8 % and 12 %. Among cases of MDR-TB in 2017, 8.5% were estimated to have XDR-TB. Drug resistant TB cases are on rise and needs planning and research for its treatment and control. A retrospective study was conducted on MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients to evaluate social and demographic profile of these patients in Bihar. A total of 700 (530 males and 170 females) MDR-TB and 51 (40 males and 11 females) XDR-TB patients were analyzed, which revealed 293 (41.86 %) patients of MDR-TB and 23 (45.10 %) patients of XDR-TB in the age group of 15 to 25 years. Mean age of MDR-TB patients in this age group was 20.52 years and for XDR-TB 21.17 years. Drug Resistant Tuberculosis Control Programme should focus adequately on youth in state of Bihar, India."

It is associated with poor treatment outcomes, multiple adverse effects to treatment and involves enormous social and economic losses. The objective of the study was to ascertain the epidemiological and behavioural correlates contributing to drug resistance among patients admitted in a tertiary hospital in Delhi with drug-resistant TB (DR-TB). A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out during the period of July-November 2013 at the Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis (RBIPMT), Delhi. All patients admitted with DR-TB for treatment were interviewed regarding social, demographic, and treatment aspects, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Their medical records were also reviewed. A total of 250 patients were included in the study; 198 (79.2%) with multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and 52 (20.8%) with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Of these, 66% patients were male and 46% came from poor socioeconomic background. All the patients had history of receiving anti-tubercular treatment (a mean of 2.3 times, range 1-6 times) before the current diagnosis of DR-TB. While 81 (32%) took treatment from private practitioner during the first episode of TB, 146 (58%) received treatment exclusively at government health facilities. Almost 87% of DR-TB patients were previously treated with category-II under RNTCP. Irregularity of treatment was reported by 88 (35%) patients. The study explores the epidemiological and behavioural correlates among the patients with drug-resistant TB. History of previous treatments for TB was a common feature among all the enrolled patients. The fact that more than half of DR-TB patients received anti-tubercular treatment exclusively in government facilities is a matter of concern. There is an urgent need to ensure treatment adherence through improved quality in service delivery in public sector and strong linkage with the private sector. Health education and patient counseling is needed to address personal level risk factors and to ensure treatment adherence."

Innovative technology is the need of the hour to identify these cases that remain either undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed due to the unavailability of appropriate tools at primary healthcare settings. We developed and evaluated 3 kits, namely 'TB Detect' (containing BioFM-Filter device), 'TB Concentration and Transport' (containing Trans-Filter device) and 'TB DNA Extraction' kits. These kits enable bio-safe equipment-free concentration of sputum on filters and improved fluorescence microscopy at primary healthcare centres, ambient temperature transport of dried inactivated sputum filters to central laboratories and molecular detection of drug resistance by PCR and DNA sequencing (Mol-DST). In a 2-site evaluation (n = 1190 sputum specimens) on presumptive TB patients, BioFM-Filter smear exhibited a significant increase in positivity of 7% and 4% over ZN smear and LED-FM smear (p<0.05), respectively and an increment in smear grade status (1+ or 2+ to 3+) of 16% over ZN smear and 20% over LED-FM smear. The sensitivity of Mol-DST in presumptive MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases (n = 148) was 90% for Rifampicin (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-96%), 84% for Isoniazid (95% CI, 72-92%), 83% for Fluoroquinolones (95% CI, 66-93%) and 75% for Aminoglycosides (95% CI, 35-97%), using phenotypic DST as the reference standard. Test specificity was 88-93% and concordance was ~89-92% (κ value 0.8-0.9). The patient-friendly kits described here address several of the existing challenges and are designed to provide 'Universal Access' to rapid TB diagnosis, including drug-resistant disease. Their utility was demonstrated by application to sputum at 2 sites in India. Our findings pave the way for larger studies in different point-of-care settings, including high-density urban areas and remote geographical locations."
31151497,Second-line injectable induced ototoxicity in drug resistant tuberculosis: A systematic review of Indian studies.,The Indian journal of tuberculosis,2019,Sarin R; Behera D; Khanna A; Singh V; Narang P; Deepak TS,"Second-line injectables (SLIs) form an essential class of agents in the treatment of drug resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB). However, their use is sometimes limited due to serious adverse events like ototoxicity and hearing loss, leading to permanent hearing loss if SLIs are continued. Globally as well as in India a wide variation in incidence of ototoxicity/hearing loss has been reported in patients with DR-TB. In this systematic analysis, we attempt to ascertain the ototoxicity of SLIs in Indian patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) wherein ototoxicity onset was assessed using audiometry performed at both pre- and post-SLI treatment initiation. Twenty two studies were identified based on the inclusion criteria. Ototoxicity was observed in 10.12% [349/3447] patients within 3.8 ± 2.6 months of treatment initiation when the ototoxicity was assessed either with or without audiometry assessment. Only five studies reported ototoxicity assessment with PTA at both pre- and post-SLI initiation and ototoxicity was observed in 27.01% (121/448) patients in these five studies. Sensorineural loss was observed in three studies (high frequency loss: capreomycin, 25.0% [1/4 patients]; amikacin, 19.7% [12/61]; kanamycin, 13.3% [22/166]; streptomycin, 11.8% [2/17]; flat loss: amikacin, 8.2% [5/61]; streptomycin, 5.9% [1/17]; kanamycin 4.8% [8/166]). Most of the patients experiencing ototoxicity were managed by discontinuing (49.6% [120/242]) or replacing SLI treatment (40.8% [49/120]). The study identified high prevalence of ototoxicity in Indian patients with DR-TB treated with SLI when ototoxicity was monitored regularly using PTA (27.01%), warranting a need to develop unified guidelines for monitoring ototoxicity, improving physician awareness and educating patients/caregivers for reporting symptoms of hearing loss."
31151492,Isoniazid mono-resistant tuberculosis: Time to take it seriously.,The Indian journal of tuberculosis,2019,Garg K; Saini V; Dhillon R; Agarwal P,"In drug resistant tuberculosis (DRTB) suspects, rifampicin resistance has always been prioritized, hence Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) is recommended under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), India. However, since it doesn't detect isoniazid resistance, rifampicin sensitive patients with unknown isoniazid status may be erroneously treated as drug sensitive TB, leading to poor treatment outcomes and emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. Hence isoniazid mono-resistance should be specifically looked for and treated as per recommendations. The objective of the present study, almost the first of its kind in India, was to evaluate the burden of isoniazid mono-resistance amongst patients diagnosed with DRTB and to study the association of different patient and disease related factors with treatment outcomes under the treatment regimen specific for isoniazid mono-resistance, started from January 1, 2017 in our state, under RNTCP. It was a retrospective study which scrutinized medical records of 52 isoniazid mono-resistant TB patients started on treatment under RNTCP between January 1 to December 31, 2017. Necessary information on possible patient and disease related predicting factors like gender, age, type of mutation (katG/inhA), weight band (26-45 kg/46-70 kg), total serum protein/albumin levels, previous history of anti-tubercular treatment (ATT), history of smoking, HIV status, presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), presence of anemia, occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADR) during treatment and duration of intensive phase (IP), was retrieved. These factors were analyzed for their possible association with treatment outcomes. Out of 103 DRTB patients enrolled, 50.5% (52/103) patients were diagnosed with isoniazid mono-resistance. 50/103 were MDR-TB and 1/103 were extensively-drug resistant TB (XDR-TB). Further analysis of these 52 isoniazid mono-resistant patients revealed:35 (67.3%) were males and 17 (32.7%) females. 27 (51.9%) patients were <30 years, 25 (48.1%) being ≥30 years of age. All patients were negative for HIV. 34/52 (65.4%) patients were declared cured, 15/52 were lost to follow up (LTFU) and 3/52 died (1 male, 2 females). Excluding these 3 patients who died, cure rates were significantly better in females (14/15 = 93.3%), with only 1/15 LTFU, than males (20/34 = 58.8% cure, 14/34 = 41.2% LTFU), (p = 0.019). Patients who were <30 years of age had significantly better cure rates (21/25 = 84%) with lesser LTFU's (4/25 = 16%), than those ≥30years of age (13/24 = 54.2% cure, 11/24 = 45.8% LTFU), (p = 0.032). Review of previous history of ATT revealed that 33 patients had primary isoniazid mono-resistance, 4 patients had previous history of being LTFU, 9 had recurrent TB and 3 were labeled as failure. Cure rates were significantly better in primary isoniazid mono-resistant patients (26/33 = 78.8%), than those with previous history of being LTFU(0/4), (p = 0.04). Type of mutation, weight band, total serum protein/albumin, history of smoking, presence of DM, presence of anemia, occurrence of ADR and duration of IP did not affect treatment outcomes. Isoniazid mono-resistance formed a major chunk of DRTB, with majority of the patients detected with primary mono-resistance. Strategically framed treatment regimens for isoniazid mono-resistance under RNTCP in India are effective in a wide range of population. Still, there are high chances of LTFU/default, which needs to be addressed on priority. Male gender, age ≥30 years and being LTFU in the past are associated with poorer cure rates, hence should be paid special attention."

Palliative care is concerned with improving quality of life and relieving sufferings in patients with advanced incurable terminal diseases. Palliative care in India is still in infancy stage due to lack of knowledge, attitude and skills among health care providers. The reason being lack of training in under graduate as well as postgraduate teaching curriculum and lack of sensitization among policy makers. To assess the awareness, interest, practices and knowledge in palliative care among medical professionals working in a tertiary care hospital. All participants were mailed proforma to be filled in a fixed format including details of their qualification, demographic data, their field of work, their training in palliative care and multiple choice questions regarding awareness interest, practices and knowledge of palliative care. Out of 186 respondents, 56% had not received any basic training in palliative care. 81% wanted palliative care education to be included in undergraduate curriculum. Poor program was identified as the most common barrier in learning palliative care. 77% respondents had no idea about home based palliative care services. 50.8% patients dies in hospital in their terminal stage. 88% were interested in learning safe opioid practices. Although 89.8% were aware of the need of palliative care in metastatic cancer but less than 50% were aware of the fact that palliative care is also required in MDR-TB and mental illness. This study reflects data of an apex cancer institute of the country. The result of awareness is not very encouraging despite a dedicated palliative care department. So, we can assume what will be the palliative care status in other parts of India where there is no palliative care at all. We strongly recommends that palliative care teaching should be incorporated in undergraduate curriculum to sensitize the students from the beginning. Budding residents in their learning phase can play an important role by learning and providing palliative care as the first person to come into contact with the patients are residents. There is a strong need of spreading palliative care awareness all over the country."

Some of them are widely distributed and associated with drug resistance, whereas others are locally predominated. Molecular epidemiological investigations have always been beneficial in identifying new strains and studying their transmission dynamics. Sahariya a primitive tribe of North Madhya Pradesh, India, has already been reported to have high prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) than their non-tribal neighbours. However, the information about MTB genotypes prevalent in Sahariya tribe and their non-tribal neighbours is not available. A total of 214 clinical isolates representing Sahariya tribe and non-tribes were analyzed by spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing. The EAI3_IND/SIT11 genotype was observed as major genotype in Sahariya tribe followed by CAS1_Delhi/SIT26 genotype. A 3.04 fold higher risk of getting TB with EAI3_IND/SIT11 genotype was observed in Sahariya as compared to the non-tribal population. The EAI_IND/SIT11 genotype also found to have more number of MDR-TB cases in Sahariya as well as true and possible transmission links. In Sahariya tribe, 3 clusters (6 isolates) reflected true transmission links, whereas 8 clusters consisted of 26 isolates revealed possible transmission links within the same geographical location or nearby houses. The present study highlighted the predominance of EAI3_IND/SIT11 genotype in Sahariya tribe followed by CAS1_Delhi/SIT26 genotype. Combined approach of MIRU-VNTR typing and spoligotyping was observed more favourable in discrimination of MTB genotypes. Further, longitudinal studies using whole genome sequencing can provide more insights into genetic diversity, drug resistance and transmission dynamics of these prevalent genotypes."

Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment is costly and involves duration as long as 2 years. To estimate costs to patients undergoing treatment for MDR-TB. A health-economics questionnaire was administered to 50 consecutive patients who successfully completed ambulatory private treatment for MDR-TB. Direct costs included drug costs, investigations, consultation fees, travel costs, hospitalisation and invasive procedures and cost prior to presentation to us. Indirect costs included loss of income. Of our cohort of 50 patients, 36 had pulmonary TB while 14 had extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB). 40 had MDR-TB and 10 had XDR-TB. There were 15 males and 35 females. Mean age was 30 years (range 16-61 years). Treatment cost for pulmonary MDR-TB averaged $5723 while it averaged $8401 for pulmonary XDR-TB and $5609 for EPTB. The major expense was due to drug costs (37%) while consultation fees were only 5%. Annual individual income for the cohort ranged from $0 to $63,000 (mean $11,430). On average, the cost of treatment ranged from 2.56% to 180.34% of the annual family income. 34/50 (68%) had total costs greater than 20% of annual family income and 39/50 (78%) had total costs greater than 10% of annual family income. The number of patients with total costs >40% of total family income was 22. MDR-TB in the private sector results in ""catastrophic health costs"". Financial and social support is essential for patients undergoing treatment for MDR-TB."

Central Asian Strain (CAS) has been reported as one of the dominant families contributing to MDR-TB in South Asia including Nepal, India and Pakistan. The aim of this study was to better understand the genetic characteristics of MDR-TB CAS family isolates circulating in Nepal and compare the results with neighboring countries. A total of 145 MDR-TB CAS family isolates collected in Nepal from 2008 to 2013 were analyzed by spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) analysis. In addition, we compared these data with published data from India and Pakistan to investigate a possible epidemiological link via construction of a minimum spanning tree (MST). Spoligotyping analysis exhibited CAS1_Delhi SIT26 (n=60) as the predominant lineage among the MDR-TB CAS family in all three countries. However, the combined analysis with spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR further discriminated 60 isolates into 49 different types and 5 clusters. Each cluster was composed of 14 isolates with a clustering rate of 23.3%, suggesting ongoing transmissions. Based on MST data from neighboring countries, we elucidated an evolutionary relationship between the two countries, Nepal and India, which could be explained by their open border. This study identified the evolutionary relationships among MDR-TB CAS1_Delhi subfamily isolates from Nepal and those from neighboring countries."

The study was designed to understand the genetic diversity and phenotype - genotype association of drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains, infecting Sahariya tribe. A total of 103 pulmonary tuberculosis patients from Sahariya tribe were recruited from Gwalior and Sheopur districts. Sputum samples were collected and cultured on LJ slants and drug sensitivity tests were carried out. Genomic DNA was extracted, followed by spoligotyping and genotyping of drug target genes, katG and rpoB, using MAS-PCR, PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing. Seventeen different spoligotypes were identified, in which, EAI3_IND/ST11 M. tuberculosis strain appeared predominant, followed by CAS1_Delhi/ST26. Results of our phenotypic drug susceptibility test identified high incidence (12.6%) of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis, while 4.85% isolates were multi drug resistant (MDR). Further genotyping of drug target genes identified 8.7% of isoniazid-R isolates to have a mutation at katG codon 463, while 3.8% isolates showed mutations at two sites, katG codons 315 and 463. In case of MDR-TB isolates, all from CAS lineage, 3.85% had mutations on katG and rpoB genes, at codon 463 and codon 526, respectively, while 0.97% isolates were harbouring mutations at codons 315, 463 and 531. Our findings have revealed that EAI3_IND strain is the predominant strain infecting Sahariya. The incidence of isoniazid-R M. tuberculosis strain infection is high, with an increased propensity to evolve into MDR-TB. Therefore, the TB centres should also consider isoniazid-R status of the isolates along with CBNAAT before deciding the drug regimen for the patients."

Rapid detection of MDR-TB allows the establishment of an effective treatment regimen; minimizes the risk of further resistance, and limits the spread of drug-resistant strains. Early diagnosis of MDR-TB is the need of the hour in high-TB burden countries like India, and GenotypeMTBDRplus is quite sensitive and specific in determining the molecular resistance in drugs such as rifampicin and isoniazid. The present study was done for molecular detection of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance and resistance patterns among MDR-TB suspects and comparison of resistance patterns among new and previously treated cases by GenoType MDR-TB was detected 11.02%, 20.03% in new and previously treated cases. Among MDR-TB patients S531 L was the most common mutation detected in rpoB gene; 71.43% in new, and 72.17% in previously treated cases. S315T1 was the most common mutation noted in katG gene; 100% in new and 81.74% in previously treated. While in hA gene, it was C15T (7.8%) among previously treated cases. MDR-TB has high prevalence in the western part of Uttar Pradesh, India. Previously treated cases have even more high rate of MDR-TB than new TB cases. The most dominant gene mutations associated with resistance to INH and RIF were observed in codon 315 of the katG gene and codon 531 of the rpoB gene. While comparing the mutation patterns by Genotype MTBDRplus assay, previously treated cases showed more diversity of mutations and had greater number of unknown mutations."

Despite guidance on improving treatment outcomes, there is little focus on how to support individuals in their suffering. Palliative care is therefore proposed as a necessary component in the global strategy to fight Tuberculosis. We aim to describe the informal resources and networks available to persons affected by Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, how they are accessed and how they are integrated into everyday lives. In-depth ethnographic research was conducted in Bengaluru, India. Informal interactions and observations were recorded across a range of palliative care and tuberculosis treatment providers over a month-long period. In addition, ten individuals with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis were asked for in-depth interviews, and five agreed. Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis caused a dynamic chain of events that transgress through physical and psychological domains to cause human suffering. Participants utilised support from their family and friends to build a network of care that was of therapeutic benefit. Informal care networks were similar to the holistic model of care practice by specialist palliative care services and represent an underused resource with enormous potential. Patient suffering is poorly addressed in current Tuberculosis treatment programmes. A community-based palliative care approach may extend peoples' support networks, helping to alleviate suffering. Further research on existing support structures and integration of these services into Tuberculosis control programmes is required."

A total of 108 MDR-TB patients were analyzed retrospectively who registered and received treatment during the year of 2014 and 2015 at district TB centre, Rajkot. MDR patients who died or transferred out or defaulter before completion of intensive phase were excluded from the analysis. Of total 108 patients majority patients (64.81%) were in young (20-39 years) with m:f: 2:1. All MDR-TB patients were retreated cases and 69.44% were ""undernutrition category"". Culture conversion rate was 86.91% at 4 months of treatment. Cure rate was 50.93% while defaulter rate and died rate was same (17.59%). Failure rate was 18.51%. Weight improvement was significantly associated with cure rate. The incidence of ADR was 32.71%. Most frequent ADRs were related to gastrointestinal system (34.42%), ototoxicity (13.11%), and central nervous system (8.1%). Aminoglycosides, cycloserine, and ethambutol were discontinued due to ADR. Majority ADRs (77.04%) were ""possible"" category by causality assessment and ""mild"" in severity assessment. Ototoxicity was only severe ADRs observed. Cure rate was improved than previous years at same center. Attention should be paid for defaulters."
30248414,Whole-genome sequencing reveals genetic signature of bedaquiline resistance in a clinical isolate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2018,Chawla K; Martinez E; Kumar A; Shenoy VP; Sintchenko V,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains has opened up new challenges for tuberculosis (TB) control in India. This study examined molecular markers of resistance to bedaquiline, a new antituberculous drug with the potential to dramatically improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes and to reduce mortality. A clinical M. tuberculosis isolate with a MDR-TB profile was subjected to whole-genome sequencing using an Illumina NextSeq500 platform, followed by genome-wide sequence analysis. A mutation in the Rv0678 coding region associated with in vitro bedaquiline resistance was identified. The strain represented the Delhi/CAS lineage. This first report of a potentially bedaquiline-resistant M. tuberculosis strain in India highlights the role of genome-wide sequence analysis of isolates from TB cases with a history of treatment in countries with a high burden of MDR-TB and XDR-TB."

We aimed to determine the delay from being eligible for DST to performing DST and factors associated with the delay. This was a retrospective cohort study involving record review among presumptive MDR-TB patients who underwent genotypic DST from five selected districts in the state of Gujarat, India (2014). Specimens were couriered from the designated microscopy centres (DMCs) to two designated genotypic DST facilities located outside the districts. Of 2212 patients, the median duration from eligibility to the specimen being sent, from the specimen being sent to DST and from eligibility to DST was 3, 5 and 8 d, respectively. Patients from DMCs in teaching hospitals and with presumptive MDR-TB criteria 'follow-up smear positive' and 'TB-human immunodeficiency virus co-infection' had a significantly higher risk of delay between eligibility and testing (≥8 d). The delay in the specimen being sent after eligibility contributed to high delays in these subgroups. The districts were doing well in implementing timely DST among presumptive MDR-TB patients. However, there is room for improvement in reducing the delays in the sending of specimens among certain patient subgroups."

29933863,Active case finding of rifampicin sensitive and resistant TB among household contacts of drug resistant TB patients in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states of India - A systematic screening intervention.,The Indian journal of tuberculosis,2018,Chatla C; Jaju J; Achanta S; Samyuktha R; Chakramahanti S; Purad C; Chepuri R; Nair SA; Parmar M,"India has the world's highest estimated burden of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). While prevalence of MDR-TB is known to be 2-3% among new TB patients and 12-17% in previously treated patients, programmatic information on the extent of transmission of TB and MDR-TB among household contacts of known MDR-TB patients is scarce. Systematic screening of household contacts of all MDR-TB patients on treatment was implemented as an intervention in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states of India. We undertook this prospective interventional study to measure the extent of TB symptoms developed among the household contacts of the known MDR-TB patients treated under Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP). The extent of rifampicin sensitive or resistance TB, bacteriologically confirmed using Xpert MTB-RIF, was examined among the symptomatic household contacts. All MDR-TB patients registered and on treatment under RNTCP between July 2011 and Sep 2013 in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States were selected for the study. They were contacted through home visit by the trained RNTCP teams during 11th Dec 2013 and 7th Jan 2014. All household contacts of MDR-TB patients were screened once for TB symptoms such as cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats, and haemoptysis and extra pulmonary site specific symptoms if any. If found symptomatic, two sputum specimen were collected (spot-morning) from each of the contact and transported for testing on Xpert MTB-RIF for detection of pulmonary TB with or without RR-TB. A total of 1750 MDR-TB patients were registered between July 2011 and Sep 2013. Of these, 1602 (91.5%) MDR-TB patients were included in the study. A total of 4858 household contacts of these 1602 patients were identified with an average of 3 contacts per MDR-TB patient. Of these, after excluding 87 (1.8%) contacts with past history of diagnosis and/or treatment for TB, 4771 (98.2%) contacts were screened for current signs and symptoms suggestive of TB. Their mean age was 28.5 years and 2151 (45%) were females. Of the 4771 contacts screened, 793 (16.6%) had at least one of the symptoms suggestive of TB of whom 781 (98.5%) had two sputum specimen transported and tested on Xpert MTB-Rif. Specimen could not be collected during the study period in 12 symptomatic patients including 4 with symptoms of extra pulmonary TB. Among 781 symptomatic contacts examined, 34 (4.4%) were bacteriologically confirmed with TB and 15 (44%) also had Rif resistance (RR). High extent of TB, particularly RR-TB was observed among household contacts of known MDR-TB patients with symptom screening and early diagnosis using Xpert-MTB-Rif. Regular systematic active screening for TB and MDR-TB among this highly vulnerable group using Xpert-MTB-Rif is useful in India for early diagnosis among close contacts of known MDR-TB patients."
29933862,Cost effectiveness of decentralised care model for managing MDR-TB in India.,The Indian journal of tuberculosis,2018,John D; Chatterjee P; Murthy S; Bhat R; Musa BM,"In India, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients are usually treated in hospitals. Decentralised care model, however, has been suggested as a possible alternative by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the ""End TB Strategy"", the WHO highlights, as one of the key targets for 2035, that 'no TB-affected families should face catastrophic hardship due to the tuberculosis'. Removal of financial barriers to health-care access and mitigation of catastrophic expenditures are therefore considered vital to achieve the universal health coverage (UHC) goal. Since forgoing healthcare due to the financial constraints is a known fact in India, decentralised care as an intervention choice (as against hospital-based care) might enhance equity provided it is an affordable choice. Thus, an economic evaluation was conducted, from the perspective of the national health system in India, to assess the cost-effectiveness of decentralised care compared to centralised care for MDR-TB. This study uses a decision-analytic model with a follow-up of two years to assess the expected costs of the decentralised versus the centralised approaches for MDR-TB treatment. A published systematic review of observational studies yielded the MDR-TB treatment outcomes, which included treatment success, treatment default, treatment failure, and mortality parameters. It was observed that these parameters did not vary significantly between the two alternatives. Treatment costs included the following costs: hospital admission costs, clinic costs, visits to laboratory and MDR-TB centre, drug therapy, injections and food. Costs data of drugs, diagnosis, hospital stay and travel to public facilities, based on a simple market survey, were taken from a recently published study on MDR-TB expenditures in the Chhattisgarh state of India. Potential cost savings related to the implementation of decentralised MDR-TB care for all patients who initiated MDR-TB treatment in India were additionally estimated. Estimated average expected total treatment cost was US$ 3390.56 for the hospital-based model and US$ 1724.1 for the decentralised model for a patient treated for MDR-TB in India, generating potential savings of US$1666.50 per case, with ICER US$ 2382.68 per QALY gained. One of the primary drivers of this difference was the significantly more intensive (thus expensive) stay charges in the hospital. If the costs and treatment probabilities are extrapolated to the whole country, with 48114 MDR-TB patients initiated on treatment in 2017, decentralised care would have additional 1058 patients cured, gain additional 3824 QALYs, and avert 2165 deaths, as compared to centralised care, in India. At various scenarios of coverage rates of decentralised and centralised care the cost difference would range between 23% and 94% for the country. Our study provides evidence of cost savings for MDR-TB patients if patients choose decentralised treatment in comparison to suggested hospitalisation of these patients for centralised treatment with similar outcomes. The economic evaluation presented in this study expected significant efficiency gains in choice of two treatment options and the cost savings may improve equity. In India, treatment of MDR-TB using decentralised care is expected to result in similar patient outcomes at markedly reduced public health costs compared with centralised care."

Inadequate diagnostic methods, suboptimal treatment and monitoring, and the lack of vigilant reporting system are some of the contributing factors for the failure of TB control. To know the current practices among local pediatricians regarding management of TB. Field based cross sectional study. All the registered pediatricians who were practicing in Mangalore, (list - local IAP branch) were included in the study. A structured Questionnaire on signs and symptoms of TB, diagnosis, strategies adopted in treatment, MDR tuberculosis and reporting of cases to RNTCP was asked. Management practice standards according to the Updated National Guidelines for Pediatric Tuberculosis in India, 2012, RNTCP guidelines in consensus with IAP, latest at the time of the study. 50 pediatricians participated in the study with 62% having an attachment to the teaching institution. More than 50% identified all the symptoms of TB. 64% were sending chest X-ray, Mantoux test and gastric lavage/induced sputum examination for AFB to diagnose TB. 22% were not stressing for AFB examination. Still 16% told serological tests as one of the diagnostic modality. 52% were not aware about the diagnosis of latent TB. In 16% of their cases ATT was on a trial basis. Only 52% of the clinicians are adhering to updated national (RNTCP) guidelines. 30% felt still there are drawbacks in the current RNTCP guidelines. 72% knew the correct definition of MDR tuberculosis. But only 36% of them knew the diagnostic method (gene expert/CB NAAT) of confirming the MDR TB. Management practices are found to be still suboptimum. Better engagement of the private sector is urgently required to improve TB management practices and to prevent diagnostic delay and drug resistance."

Skeletal tuberculosis accounts up to 10% of all extra pulmonary tuberculosis. World Health Organisation (WHO) has not formulated guidelines for the management of Multi-drug resistant skeletal tuberculosis. A retrospective analysis of patients treated for musculoskeletal tuberculosis was done, to study drug resistance patterns. The outcome was assessed both clinically and radiologically.898 patients were treated for skeletal tuberculosis during the period of 2006-2013 (96 months). 478 (53.2%) patients were treated for tubercular spondylitis and 420 (46.8%) for extra-spinal skeletal tuberculosis. Ninety two patients (10.2%) had documented resistance to the anti-tubercular drugs. There were 42 mono resistant tuberculosis cases (4.7%), 13 poly resistant cases (1.4%), 33 multi-drug resistant cases (MDR TB) (3.7%) and 4 (0.4%) extremely drug resistant tuberculosis cases (XDR). All the patients were treated medically as per drug susceptibility patterns and protocols. Surgery was performed when indicated in 59 (66%) cases. 85% completed their course of treatment and were successfully healed as per pre-set clinical, biochemical and radiological criteria. The remaining were lost to follow up. One patient died as a result of post op respiratory infection. The prevalence of Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients in our centre was 3.7% and that of Extremely drug resistant tuberculosis cases was 0.4%. A Multi-disciplinary approach with drug susceptibility tests, sensitive drugs, and surgery if required is essential. Health education is essential to improve awareness among health care professionals about the danger of drug resistance in tuberculosis."

In this study, molecular epidemiological characteristics associated with INH resistance mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in codon katG315 and in the promoter region of the inhA gene were investigated. Sputum specimens of smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients were subjected to GenoType MTBDRplus assay to identify katG and inhA mutations in M. tuberculosis. In addition to the current study, 17 publications assessed 14100 genotypically resistant M. tuberculosis isolates for mutations in katG inclusive of codon 315. In total, 1821 (11.8%) of 15438 INH-resistant strains had detectable mutations: 71.0% in katG315 and 29.0% in the inhA promoter region. The prevalence of IHN monoresistance was 89.1% in the economically-active age group, 0.4% in the paediatric age group and 10.5% in those aged >60years; the rate in males and females was 12.0% and 10.8%, respectively. Meta-analysis derived a pooled katGS315T resistant TB prevalence of 67.3% (95% CI 59.3-75.4%) with Q=732.19, I INH resistance was spread widely and transmission of INH-resistant isolates, especially with katG315T mutation, was confirmed. Therefore, it is important to diagnose katG315T mutants among INH-resistant strains as it may be a risk factor for subsequent development of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Prompt detection of patients with INH-resistant strains would expedite modification of treatment regimens, and appropriate infection control measures could be taken in time to diminish the risk of further development and transmission of MDR-TB."

Descriptive retrospective study. Children were defined as having DR-TB on the basis of GeneXpert or line probe assay and/or drug susceptibility testing (DST) of M. tuberculosis grown on culture or from contact's DST. The prevalence of DR-TB was 110 of 1145 cases (9.6%), which showed an increase, compared with 5.6% pre-2010 and 7% in 2010-2013 (P = 0.014408). Twenty-two children (20%) had pulmonary-TB and 88 (80%) had extra-pulmonary-TB with disseminated-TB being the most common presentation in 31 children (28.18%). Ninety-six children (87.3%) were bacteriologically confirmed TB cases, and 14 (12.7%) were clinically diagnosed-TB and treated as per contact DST. Eight cases (7.2%) were monoresistant, 7 (6.3%) polyresistant, MDR-TB seen in 28 patients (25.45%), 32 (29.09%) had pre-XDR-TB, 9 (8.18%) had XDR-TB and 12 (10.9%) were rifampicin resistant. Ethionamide resistance increased from 26.1% pre-2013 to 60.8% post-2013 (P = 0.014408) and ofloxacin resistance rose from 30.4% pre-2010, to 47.6% in 2010-2013 and 56.9% post-2013 (P = 0.080863).

Most treatment failures for patients with MDR TB are due to death during TB treatment. We sought to determine the proportion of deaths during MDR TB treatment attributable to TB itself. We used a structured verbal autopsy tool to interview family members of patients who died during MDR TB treatment in India during January-December 2016. A committee triangulated information from verbal autopsy, death certificate, or other medical records available with the family members to ascertain the underlying cause of death. For 66% of patient deaths (47/71), TB was the underlying cause of death. We assigned TB as the underlying cause of death for an additional 6 patients who died of suicide and 2 of pulmonary embolism. Deaths during TB treatment signify program failure; accurately determining the cause of death is the first step to designing appropriate, timely interventions to prevent premature deaths."
29406800,Rapid molecular diagnostics for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in India.,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2018,Ramachandran R; Muniyandi M,"Rapid molecular diagnostic methods help in the detection of TB and Rifampicin resistance. These methods detect TB early, are accurate and play a crucial role in reducing the burden of drug resistant tuberculosis. Areas covered: This review analyses rapid molecular diagnostic tools used in the diagnosis of MDR-TB in India, such as the Line Probe Assay and GeneXpert. We have discussed the burden of MDR-TB and the impact of recent diagnostic tools on case detection and treatment outcomes. This review also discusses the costs involved in establishing these new techniques in India. Expert commentary: Molecular methods have considerable advantages for the programmatic management of drug resistant TB. These include speed, standardization of testing, potentially high throughput and reduced laboratory biosafety requirements. There is a desperate need for India to adopt modern, rapid, molecular tools with point-of-care tests being currently evaluated. New molecular diagnostic tests appear to be cost effective and also help in detecting missing cases. There is enough evidence to support the scaling up of these new tools in India."

To address these challenges, Chhattisgarh state in India has established a MDR-TB financial protection policy by creating MDR-TB benefit packages as part of the universal health insurance scheme that the state has rolled out in their effort towards attaining Universal Health Coverage for all its residents. In these schemes the state purchases health insurance against set packages of services from third party health insurance agencies on behalf of all its residents. Provider payment reform by strategic purchasing through output based payments (lump sum fee is reimbursed as per the MDR-TB benefit package rates) to the providers - both public and private health facilities empanelled under the insurance scheme was the key intervention. To understand the implementation gap between policy and practice of the benefit packages with respect to equity in utilization of package claims by the poor patients in public and private sector. Data from primary health insurance claims from January 2013 to December 2015, were analysed using an extension of 'Kingdon's multiple streams for policy implementation framework' to explain the implementation gap between policy and practice of the MDR-TB benefit packages. The total number of claims for MDR-TB benefit packages increased over the study period mainly from poor patients treated in public facilities, particularly for the pre-treatment evaluation and hospital stay packages. Variations and inequities in utilizing the packages were observed between poor and non-poor beneficiaries in public and private sector. Private providers participation in the new MDR-TB financial protection mechanism through the universal health insurance scheme was observed to be much lower than might be expected given their share of healthcare provision overall in India. Our findings suggest that there may be an implementation gap due to weak coupling between the problem and the policy streams, reflecting weak coordination between state nodal agency and the state TB department. There is a pressing need to build strong institutional capacity of the public and private sector for improving service delivery to MDR-TB patients through this new health insurance mechanism."
28887289,Baseline resistance and cross-resistance among fluoroquinolones in multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates at a national reference laboratory in India.,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2018,Mamatha HG; Shanthi V,"Pre-existing fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) patients is a major threat in treating MDR-TB. This study was conducted to assess the percentage of FQ resistance among MDR-TB patients and to determine whether there is complete cross-resistance between FQs [ofloxacin (OFX), levofloxacin (LVX) and moxifloxacin (MXF)] used as second-line drugs in MDR-TB treatment. Among 879 MDR-TB suspects tested, 68 were confirmed to be MDR-TB and rifampicin (RIF) monoresistant. Suspects were further analysed for FQ resistance by drug susceptibility testing (DST) using Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for OFX, LVX and MXF. Of 879 MDR-TB suspects, RIF resistance was observed in 70 patients (8.0%), among which pre-existing FQ resistance was detected in 32%. Moreover, 88% of isolates exhibited a similar DST pattern for all three FQs tested. Cross-resistance among FQs was not complete in eight isolates; the MIC of MXF was found to be much lower than the MICs of OFX and LVX. A huge proportion of MDR-TB strains (32%) exhibiting OFX resistance prior to treatment with second-line anti-TB drugs raises major concern. Detection of baseline drug resistance in TB patients helps in reducing the transmission of drug-resistant TB. The OFX MIC was higher than its critical concentration, indicating the prevalence of baseline resistance to FQs owing to irrational use of these drugs."
