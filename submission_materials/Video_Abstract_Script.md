# Video Abstract Script
## "India's MDR-TB Future: Stagnation or Elimination?"

**Duration:** 3 minutes  
**Format:** Voiceover with animated slides  
**Target Audience:** Researchers, policymakers, healthcare professionals

---

## SLIDE 1: Title Card (0:00-0:10)
**Visual:** Title with animated background of India map, TB bacteria icons

**Voiceover:**
"India's Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Crisis: Are we headed for stagnation or elimination? This study provides the answer."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem (0:10-0:35)
**Visual:** Animated graph showing rising MDR-TB cases 2017-2024, then plateauing

**Voiceover:**
"India has the world's highest burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis—accounting for 27% of global cases. Over the past decade, we've dramatically expanded diagnostic capacity, detecting 65,000 cases annually. But the numbers have plateaued. What does the future hold? Will we see elimination, or will we remain stuck at this high level indefinitely?"

---

## SLIDE 3: The Data Gap (0:35-0:55)
**Visual:** Question mark over India map, then transition to data icons (WHO, ICMR logos)

**Voiceover:**
"Previous forecasts relied on simple linear models that couldn't capture the complex dynamics of mature epidemics. We needed a more sophisticated approach. Using eight years of verified surveillance data from WHO and India's National TB Program, we built an advanced forecasting model to answer this critical question."

---

## SLIDE 4: The Method (0:55-1:25)
**Visual:** Animated diagram showing Holt-Winters model components, damping curve

**Voiceover:**
"We employed Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing with a damped trend—a technique that accounts for the 'saturation effect' we're seeing in public health interventions. Unlike linear models that predict unrealistic infinite growth or decline, our approach recognizes that interventions have diminishing returns. We validated this model against seven alternatives and confirmed it was the best fit. We also ran 1,000 bootstrap simulations to quantify uncertainty."

---

## SLIDE 5: Three Futures (1:25-2:00)
**Visual:** Three diverging arrows from 2025, color-coded (gray, green, red)

**Voiceover:**
"Our analysis reveals three possible futures for India:

**Status Quo** [gray arrow]: If we continue current strategies, the burden will stagnate at 84,000 cases per year through 2035. No progress toward elimination.

**Optimistic** [green arrow]: If we aggressively scale up preventive therapy and active case finding, we could reduce the burden to 60,000 cases by 2030—averting 217,000 infections over the decade.

**Pessimistic** [red arrow]: If antimicrobial resistance escalates and private sector quality deteriorates, we could see cases rise to 92,000 per year."

---

## SLIDE 6: The Policy Gap (2:00-2:25)
**Visual:** Animated infographic showing 30,000 cases difference, $3.8B savings, 4.4:1 ROI

**Voiceover:**
"The difference between these scenarios is stark. By 2030, the gap between Status Quo and Optimistic is 30,000 cases per year—30,000 human lives. Over the decade, the Optimistic strategy would save $3.8 billion dollars and deliver a 4.4-to-1 return on investment. The economic case is as compelling as the humanitarian one."

---

## SLIDE 7: What Needs to Happen (2:25-2:45)
**Visual:** Three icons with percentages: pill bottle (80%), magnifying glass (high), hospital (70%)

**Voiceover:**
"To achieve the Optimistic future, India needs three critical shifts:

First, scale preventive therapy coverage from 15% to 80% for contacts of MDR-TB patients.

Second, intensify active case finding in high-risk populations—urban slums, prisons, and migrant communities.

Third, engage the private sector through quality standards and unified notification systems."

---

## SLIDE 8: The Bottom Line (2:45-3:00)
**Visual:** Split screen: left shows "Status Quo = 840,000 cases", right shows "Optimistic = 625,000 cases", difference highlighted

**Voiceover:**
"India stands at a crossroads. Business as usual means 840,000 MDR-TB cases over the next decade. Aggressive action could reduce this to 625,000—preventing over 200,000 infections. The choice is clear. The time to act is now. The evidence is here."

---

## SLIDE 9: End Card (3:00-3:05)

**Voiceover:**
