# Trends and Forecasts of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis in India (2025-2030): A Multi-Model Analysis and Policy Scenario Assessment

## Results

### 1. National Tuberculosis Burden Forecast (2025–2030)
Our multi-model ensemble analysis predicts a continued upward trajectory in total TB notifications in India over the next six years under the status quo. The Holt-Winters and Machine Learning (Ensemble) models converge to forecast an increase from **2.59 million estimated cases in 2025** (95% CI: 2.19–2.99M) to approximately **2.55–3.00 million cases by 2030**. This trend largely reflects intensified case-finding efforts and reporting improvements rather than a mere incidence rise, yet it highlights a substantial persistent burden that is not naturally declining (Figure 1A).

### 2. Emerging Threat of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis
The analysis identifies a critical epidemiological shift: while retreatment cases constitute only ~13% of the total notification volume, they disproportionately drive the drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) epidemic.
*   **Rising Resistance Rates:** The prevalence of MDR/RR-TB is projected to rise marginally from **3.6% to 4.2%** in new cases and from **13.0% to 14.0%** in retreatment cases by 2030 (Figure 1D).
*   **Projected Burden:** Consequently, the total annual burden of DR-TB is expected to reach **~158,914 cases by 2030**.
*   **Source Attribution:** Notably, **67%** (approx. 106,000 cases) of the projected DR-TB burden in 2030 will originate from *new* cases, indicating significant primary transmission of resistant strains in the community, while the remaining 33% will arise from retreatment cases (Figure 1C).

### 3. Geographic Heterogeneity and Hotspots
State-level forecasting reveals significant heterogeneity, clustering high-burden states that require prioritized intervention (Table 2, Figure 2).
*   **Critical Hotspots:** Five states—**Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan**—are projected to account for over **55%** of the national DR-TB burden. Uttar Pradesh alone is projected to face a staggering **~48,000** DR-TB cases in 2030.
*   **High Growth Zones:** States like **Jharkhand** and **Uttarakhand** are exhibiting high growth rates in notifications, signaling emerging hotspots where health system capacity may be rapidly overwhelmed if not bolstered.

### 4. Policy Scenario Analysis: The Value of Strategy
Our sensitivity analysis modeled three strategic interventions against the status quo baseline (Figure 1B, Table 1):
*   **Scenario 1: Treatment Optimization (Universal BPaL/M):** Implementing shorter, highly effective regimens like BPaL/M is crucial for mortality reduction but has a limited impact on transmission dynamics, reducing the 2030 incidence burden by only **11%** (~2.25M cases).
*   **Scenario 2: Prevention First (Active Case Finding + TPT):** Aggressive upstream interventions, including Active Case Finding (ACF) and mass Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment (TPT), demonstrated superior efficacy, reducing the projected 2030 burden by **34%** (~1.67M cases).
*   **Scenario 3: Combination Strategy (End TB):** The synergistic application of both Universal Treatment Optimization and Aggressive Prevention offers the only viable path to modifying the epidemic trajectory effectively. This combination is projected to avert **~1.2 million cases** in the year 2030 alone, essentially halving the burden (**47% reduction**) compared to the status quo.

## Discussion

### Interpretation of Findings
The results underscore a "fork in the road" for India's TB elimination program. The current trajectory, driven by robust detection but insufficient incidence reduction, leads to a plateauing high burden of nearly 3 million annual cases. The forecasted rise in primary drug resistance (DR-TB in new cases) is particularly alarming, confirming that DR-TB is no longer just a failing of treatment adherence but an established airborne epidemic spreading in communities.

### Strategic Implications
1.  **Pivot to Prevention:** The scenario analysis provides compelling evidence that treatment improvements alone (even with breakthrough regimens like BPaL) cannot end the epidemic. A paradigm shift towards blocking transmission via **Active Case Finding** and blocking progression via **TPT** is mathematically essential to bend the curve.
2.  **Targeted Geography:** Resources must not be distributed equally but equitably based on the forecasted burden. The "Big 5" states (UP, Bihar, Maharashtra, MP, Rajasthan) require a disproportionate share of advanced diagnostics (molecular tests) and second-line drugs, as they will harbor the majority of the DR-TB crisis.
3.  **Address the "New Case" Paradox:** Since two-thirds of future DR-TB cases will come from *new* patients, screening policies that reserve molecular DST only for high-risk/retreatment groups are obsolete. **Universal Upfront Molecular Testing (NAAT)** for *every* diagnosed TB patient is the only way to catch these 100,000+ primary resistant cases early.

### Limitations
This study relies on notification data, which acts as a proxy for incidence but is influenced by detection intensity. The polynomial Bayesian models assume historical trends in case-finding efficiency continue, which may not hold if the private sector engagement fluctuates.

### Conclusion
India stands at a critical juncture. Maintaining the status quo will stabilize the TB burden at an unacceptably high level, with a growing, harder-to-treat resistant component. However, the aggressive implementation of a combination strategy—prioritizing the prevention of transmission as much as the cure of the sick—can avert millions of cases and place the goal of TB elimination within reach by 2030.
