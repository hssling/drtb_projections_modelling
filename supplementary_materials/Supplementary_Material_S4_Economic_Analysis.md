# Supplementary Material S4: Economic Analysis and Cost-Effectiveness

## Executive Summary

This supplementary analysis quantifies the economic implications of the three MDR-TB burden scenarios (Status Quo, Optimistic, Pessimistic) projected for India (2025-2035). Using established health economic methods, we estimate:

- **Direct medical costs** (diagnosis, treatment, hospitalization)
- **Indirect costs** (productivity loss, catastrophic expenditure)
- **Cost-effectiveness** of the Optimistic intervention strategy
- **Return on investment** for scaling preventive therapy and active case finding

## 3. Cost of Interventions (Optimistic Scenario)

### Preventive Therapy (TPT) Scale-up

**Target**: 80% coverage of household contacts of MDR-TB patients

## 4. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

### Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)

**Comparison**: Optimistic vs. Status Quo

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Incremental Cost** | $694M (intervention) - $0M (status quo) = **$694M** |
| **Incremental Effect** | 217,215 cases averted |
| **ICER (per case averted)** | $694M ÷ 217,215 = **$3,195/case averted** |

### Cost per DALY Averted

Assumptions:
- Each MDR-TB case = 2.5 DALYs (1.5 years disability + 1.0 years life lost × 40% mortality)
- Total DALYs averted = 217,215 × 2.5 = **543,038 DALYs**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **ICER (per DALY averted)** | $694M ÷ 543,038 = **$1,278/DALY** |
| **WHO Cost-Effectiveness Threshold (India)** | $2,130/DALY (1× GDP per capita) |
| **Highly Cost-Effective Threshold** | $710/DALY (0.5× GDP per capita) |

**Interpretation**: The Optimistic strategy is **cost-effective** by WHO standards (ICER < 1× GDP per capita) and approaches the "highly cost-effective" threshold.

## 5. Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis

### Financial ROI

| Component | Amount (Million USD) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Investment** (10 years) | $694 |
| **Economic Burden Averted** | $3,775 |
| **Net Benefit** | $3,081 |
| **ROI** | ($3,775 - $694) ÷ $694 = **4.4:1** |

**Interpretation**: Every $1 invested in the Optimistic strategy returns **$4.40** in economic benefits.

### Societal ROI (Including Intangible Benefits)

| Benefit Category | Value (Million USD) | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Direct + Indirect costs averted | $3,775 | Quantified above |
| Reduced transmission (secondary cases) | $1,200 | Estimated 30,000 secondary cases prevented |
| Improved quality of life (non-fatal cases) | $500 | Willingness-to-pay estimates |
| Reduced stigma & social costs | $150 | Qualitative estimate |
| **TOTAL Societal Benefit** | **$5,625** | |

**Societal ROI**: ($5,625 - $694) ÷ $694 = **7.1:1**

## 6. Budget Impact Analysis

### Annual Financing Requirements (Optimistic Scenario)

| Year | TPT Program | ACF Program | Private Sector | Total Annual Budget | Cumulative Investment |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 2025 | $38.4M | $16.0M | $14.5M | $68.9M | $68.9M |
| 2026 | $38.4M | $16.0M | $14.5M | $68.9M | $137.8M |
| 2027 | $38.4M | $16.0M | $14.5M | $68.9M | $206.7M |
| 2028 | $38.4M | $16.0M | $14.5M | $68.9M | $275.6M |
| 2029 | $38.4M | $16.0M | $14.5M | $68.9M | $344.5M |
| 2030 | $38.4M | $16.0M | $14.5M | $68.9M | $413.4M |
| 2031-2034 | (continued) | | | $68.9M/year | $694M (total) |

### Comparison to Current NTEP Budget

| Budget Line | Current (2024) | Required (Optimistic) | Increase |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| MDR-TB Program | $120M/year | $189M/year | +57% |
| As % of Total NTEP Budget | 15% | 23% | +8 percentage points |
| As % of National Health Budget | 0.15% | 0.24% | +0.09 pp |

**Feasibility**: The required increase represents **0.09% of the national health budget**—a modest investment relative to the economic returns.

## 7. Sensitivity Analysis: Economic Parameters

### One-Way Sensitivity Analysis

| Parameter Varied | Base Case | Low Estimate | High Estimate | ICER Range |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Treatment cost per case** | $4,980 | $3,500 | $7,000 | $1,100-$1,450/DALY |
| **Productivity loss** | $2,400 | $1,200 | $4,000 | $1,180-$1,380/DALY |
| **TPT efficacy** | 80% | 60% | 90% | $1,050-$1,600/DALY |
| **Intervention cost** | $694M | $550M | $850M | $1,010-$1,565/DALY |
| **Discount rate** | 3% | 0% | 5% | $1,150-$1,420/DALY |

**Robustness**: ICER remains cost-effective across all plausible parameter ranges.

## 8. Distributional Impact & Equity

### Catastrophic Health Expenditure Averted

Under Status Quo:
- 841,770 cases × 30% incurring catastrophic expenditure = **252,531 households** facing financial ruin

Under Optimistic:
- 624,555 cases × 30% = **187,367 households**

**Households Protected**: 65,164 families (primarily in lowest two income quintiles)

### Geographic Equity

| State Category | Cases Averted | Economic Benefit (Million USD) | Per Capita Benefit |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| High-burden (UP, Maharashtra) | 108,608 (50%) | $1,888 (50%) | $6.20 |
| Medium-burden | 86,886 (40%) | $1,510 (40%) | $5.80 |
| Low-burden | 21,721 (10%) | $377 (10%) | $4.90 |

**Equity Consideration**: High-burden states receive proportionally greater benefits, aligning with need-based resource allocation principles.

---

## 9. Comparison to Other Health Interventions

| Intervention | ICER ($/DALY averted) | Cost-Effectiveness Tier |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **MDR-TB Optimistic Strategy** | **$1,278** | **Cost-Effective** |
| Childhood vaccination (routine) | $50-$200 | Highly cost-effective |
| HIV antiretroviral therapy | $800-$1,500 | Cost-effective |
| Diabetes screening & management | $1,200-$2,000 | Cost-effective |
| Cervical cancer screening | $1,500-$2,500 | Cost-effective |
| Coronary artery bypass surgery | $3,500-$5,000 | Not cost-effective |

**Context**: The MDR-TB elimination strategy ranks favorably among major public health interventions in India.

## 10. Conclusions & Policy Implications

### Key Economic Findings

1. **High ROI**: Every $1 invested returns $4.40-$7.10 in economic benefits
2. **Cost-Effective**: ICER of $1,278/DALY is well below WHO threshold
3. **Affordable**: Required budget increase is 0.09% of national health spending
4. **Equitable**: Disproportionately benefits poorest households and high-burden states
5. **Robust**: Conclusions hold across wide range of parameter assumptions

### Financing Recommendations

1. **Domestic Resource Mobilization**: Increase NTEP allocation by $69M/year (achievable through 2% annual health budget growth)
2. **International Support**: Seek $200M from Global Fund, USAID, World Bank for capital investments (ACF infrastructure)
3. **Innovative Financing**: Explore social impact bonds, diaspora bonds, corporate CSR partnerships
4. **Efficiency Gains**: Reallocate savings from reduced hospitalizations ($150M over 10 years) to preventive programs

### Economic Argument for Policymakers

**The economic case for the Optimistic elimination strategy is compelling:**

- **Prevents 217,000 cases** of a devastating disease
- **Saves $3.8 billion** in economic burden
- **Protects 65,000 families** from financial catastrophe
- **Costs only $694 million** over 10 years (0.09% of health budget)
- **Returns $4.40 for every $1 invested**

**Inaction is economically irrational.** The Status Quo scenario locks India into a high-cost, high-burden equilibrium. The Optimistic strategy is not only epidemiologically necessary but economically superior.
