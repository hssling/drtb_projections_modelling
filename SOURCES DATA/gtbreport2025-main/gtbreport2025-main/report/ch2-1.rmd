# 2.1 Case notifications  

<span class="red">**Draft! Prepared `r Sys.Date()` using country-reported data snapshot files from `r format(as.Date(snapshot_date), format="%d %B %Y")`!**</span>

Tuberculosis (TB) case notifications refer to people diagnosed with TB disease and officially reported as a case to national authorities. Case notification data have been systematically collected at national level and then reported to WHO on an annual basis since the mid-1990s, based on standard case definitions and associated guidance on the recording and reporting of data provided by WHO. The most recent WHO guidance was published in 2024 (`r ref_lnk("1")`). 

Globally in `r report_year - 1`, `r ftb(t2.1.1_global$c_newinc/1e6)` million people were diagnosed with a new episode of TB (also referred to as new and recurrent cases) and notified (`r lnk("Table 2.1.1")`). Of these, `r ftb(t2.1.1_txt$c_pulm_p)`% had pulmonary TB and `r ftb(100-t2.1.1_txt$c_pulm_p)`% had extrapulmonary TB. Three WHO regions accounted for `r ftb(t2.1.1_txt$c_newinc_cum_p)`% of total notifications: the African Region (`r ftb(t2.1.1_txt2 |> slice(1) |> select(c_total_p))`%), South-East Asia Region (`r ftb(t2.1.1_txt2 |> slice(2) |> select(c_total_p))`%) and Western Pacific Region (`r ftb(t2.1.1_txt2 |> slice(3) |> select(c_total_p))`%). In 106 countries that accounted for 87% of global notifications, 15% of people newly diagnosed with TB were reported to have been detected through screening (for further details, see <span class="red">Section 3</span>).

The `r ftb(f2.1.1_txt2$c_newinc_2024)` million people newly diagnosed with TB and notified as a TB case in `r report_year - 1` was a small increase from `r ftb(f2.1.1_txt2$c_newinc_2023)` million in `r report_year - 2`, following the large increases that occurred between 2021 and 2023 as countries recovered from major COVID-related disruptions to TB diagnosis and treatment in 2020 (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.1")`).

The historically high numbers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 can be explained by two factors: the diagnosis of a backlog of people who developed TB in previous years but whose diagnosis was delayed by COVID-related disruptions, and a rise in the overall number of people developing TB disease between 2020 and 2023 as a result of increased transmission resulting from diagnostic delays (<span style="color:#F21905">Section 1.1)</span>.

Trends in case notifications since the pre-pandemic year of 2019 vary among the six WHO regions (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.2")`). The pattern in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia regions was very similar to the global trend, with a big reduction in 2020 followed by year-on-year increases from 2021&#8211;`r report_year-1`: the South-East Asia Region drove the global trend. The pattern was also similar in the Region of the Americas,  the European Region and the Western Pacific Region; the main difference is that in these three regions, notifications fell between `r report_year-2` and `r report_year-1`. In the African Region, notifications fell only slightly in 2020 and subsequently in the African Region increased, particularly between 2021 and 2023, before levelling off in `r report_year-1`. In `r report_year-1`, the reported number of people newly diagnosed with TB in the African Region was `r ftb(f2.1.2_txt_AFR$pct)`% above the level of 2019.

In most of the 30 high TB burden countries and three global TB watchlist countries, case notifications fell in 2020 and have subsequently recovered to the pre-COVID level or beyond (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.3")`). 
Exceptions to this general pattern include three countries where notifications increased throughout the period 2019&#8211;`r report_year-1` (the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria) and three countries where a long-term historic decline continued largely uninterrupted (China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation). Two other exceptions are Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, where a relatively consistent decline for several years has been reversed since 2021 and 2020 respectively. In Ethiopia, recent increases may reflect active case finding efforts. In Zimbabwe, recent increases may reflect an underlying increase in TB incidence.

Most notified cases of TB are among adults (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.4")`). Of the global total of people notified as a new or recurrent TB case in `r report_year - 1`,  `r ftb(f2.1.4_txt %>% filter(year == report_year-1) %>% select(pct_m))`% were men, `r ftb(f2.1.4_txt %>% filter(year == report_year-1) %>% select(pct_f))`% were women and `r ftb(f2.1.4_txt %>% filter(year == report_year-1) %>% select(pct_c))`% were children aged 0&#8211;14 years (the age groups related to children for which WHO routinely collects data are 0&#8211;4 and 5&#8211;14 years; it is recognized that the second category includes young adolescents). For the remainder, either age or sex were unknown. In general, notification data appear to understate the share of the total TB disease burden that is accounted for by men, since higher male to female ratios among adults have been found in national TB prevalence surveys (<span class="red">Section 1.4</span>). The drop in case notifications between 2019 and 2020 and subsequent recovery was similar for men and women, while both the drop in 2020 and subsequent recovery were more pronounced for children.

Although the global proportion of notified cases accounted for by children aged 0&#8211;14 years has been relatively stable (7&#8211;8% of the total notifications) (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.4")`), there is considerable variation at country level (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.5")`). Among the 30 high burden countries, those with particularly low levels (<5%) included `r gsub("Viet Nam", "Viet&nbsp;Nam", gsub("(Philip)|(Democ)|(Russian)", "the \\1\\2\\3", knitr::combine_words(f2.1.4b_hbc_low_data$country_in_text_EN, oxford_comma=FALSE)))`.

There are recognized issues with the diagnosis and reporting of TB in children, including the use of variable case definitions and underreporting of cases diagnosed by paediatricians in the public and private sectors. Greater attention to the quality of TB notification data for children is warranted in many countries.

There is also considerable country variation in the proportion of notified cases diagnosed with extrapulmonary TB (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.6")`). This may reflect underlying differences in TB epidemiology as well as diagnostic practices. 

Among the 30 high TB burden and three global TB watchlist countries, the share of case notifications accounted for by people diagnosed with extrapulmonary TB was particularly high (>20%) in `r knitr::combine_words(f2.1.6_txt$country_in_text_EN, oxford_comma=FALSE)`. 
Even higher proportions were reported in some other parts of the world; examples included `r knitr::combine_words(f2.1.6_txt2$country_in_text_EN, oxford_comma=FALSE)` and several countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region.

There is striking country variation in the distribution of TB case notifications according to country of origin (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.7")`). In several countries with a low incidence of TB (<span style="color:#F21905">Section 1.1</span>), more than 75% of notified cases were among people of foreign origin.

People housed in prisons or congregate settings have a high risk of developing TB and of having poorer TB treatment outcomes than the general population. Prisons can exacerbate ill health: for example, if there is chronic lack of investment in the justice sector, contraventions of human rights, low prioritization of health and harm reduction services in prisons, and an absence of other justice-based alternatives to incarceration. The physical infrastructure of prisons, including the risk of overcrowding and the frequent movement of prisoners can increase the risk of transmitting airborne diseases such as TB.

Data about the number of people notified as a new or recurrent case of TB who were registered in prisons have been collected from all countries in the WHO European Region since 2014 and from all countries in the Region of the Americas since 2018. Data have been requested from all countries and areas (n=215) since in 2023; `r ftb(f2.1.8_txt %>% nrow())` countries and areas reported data. These data reveal considerable country variation in the percentage of people notified as a new and recurrent case of TB who were registered in prisons (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.8")`), with the highest percentages are in countries and areas in the Region of the Americas.

Engagement of all care providers in the public and private sectors through public&#8211;private and public&#8211;public mix (PPM) initiatives can help to minimize the underreporting of people diagnosed with TB. Since 2015, the contribution of such PPM initiatives to total notifications has grown in most of the seven countries defined as top global priorities for PPM (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.9")`).

Case-based digital surveillance systems enable timely reporting and use of TB data; their main advantages are highlighted in the latest WHO guidance on TB surveillance (`r ref_lnk("1")`). In `r report_year-1`, `r ftb(f2.1.11_txt$cb_n)` countries and areas that collectively accounted for `r ftb(f2.1.11_txt$pct_notif_caseb)`% of officially notified TB cases were using a case-based digital surveillance system that covered all people diagnosed with TB (`r lnk("Fig. 2.1.11")`). This was similar to the level of `r report_year-2`, when `r ftb(cb_2023_data_txt$cb_n)` countries and areas that collectively accounted for `r ftb(cb_2023_data_txt$pct_notif_caseb)`% of officially notified TB cases were using such systems. Acceleration of progress in making the transition from paper-based reporting of aggregated TB data to case-based digital TB surveillance is particularly needed in the WHO African Region.
