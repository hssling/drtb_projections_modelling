Endang Lukitosari (MINISTRY) said on 30/05/25 at 07:53: In 2023, the recording and reporting of TPT (Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy) was still carried out using Excel spreadsheets. This process was conducted outside the existing HIV AIDS Information System (SIHA), resulting in delayed and underreporting. Since 2024, all HIV and STI-related recording, including TB-HIV, has been mandated to use SIHA version 2.1. With the implementation of this system at the beginning of 2024, documentation related to TPT has significantly improved. As a result, there is a notable discrepancy when compared to the 2023 data that had been previously reported. 

As an additional information, if we compare the 2023 figures generated from SIHA 2.1, the number of people living with HIV who were newly enrolled on antiretroviral therapy and also started tuberculosis preventive treatment was 4,106.

Tatiana Costin-Codreanu (MINISTRY) said on 20/05/25 at 13:44: The main cause is the refusal of patients to take isoniazid prophylaxis for 6 months.
Starting in 2025, the RIFAPENTINE preparation will be used (short course of 12 doses in 3 months), which could favor an increase in the percentage of people who will initiate the anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis course.

Morongoe Nyakane (MINISTRY) said on 21/05/25 at 14:09: The number is correct and has declined in 2024, it includes both newly enrolled and those ever enrolled, there is no data on newly enrolled on ART and started TPT, however, the programme revised the tools to separate the newly enrolled and those already on ART who started on TPT, in the next reporting we will be able to report on that indicator. 

At the moment we don't have a reason to explain the decline, we are yet to conduct the data data quality assessment on this indicator to get to the depth of this result. Again please note that at at 2024, TPT coverage for all PLHIV is 95% so these number could be associated with the fact that now the focus is on new clients enrolled on ART,

This is due to the changes in TPT initiation policy in Zimbabwe.
Previously, patients would re-dose every three years. Currently TPT is offered to eligible new initiations and PLWHIV in care who are contacts of bacteriologically confirmed cases. The TPT patients are no longer re-dosing every three years, they only receive once in their life time unless they are contacts of bacteriologically confirmed cases

Por lo tanto, cada 3 meses se pudo ingresar nuevas personas en la profilaxis, los que permanecían adheridos, hasta completar en esquema.
