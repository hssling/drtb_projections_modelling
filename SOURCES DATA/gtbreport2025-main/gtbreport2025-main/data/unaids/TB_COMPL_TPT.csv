MSG_ERROR_TB_COMPL_TPT_NUM_PREV_YEAR","Victoria Bendaud (UNAIDS) said on 19/05/25 at 08:18: The denominator [11430] differs from the number of people reported last year to have started TB preventive treatment in 2023 [2847]. These two numbers should be the same. Please verify or provide an explanation for this difference.

Endang Lukitosari (MINISTRY) said on 30/05/25 at 07:58: As previously explained, in 2024 there was a transition in the method of recording and reporting—from using Excel-based (aggregate data) reporting to utilizing the SIHA 2.1 information system (individual data). This shift has resulted in discrepancies in the 2023 figures, both in the data that was previously reported in the 2023 GAM and the data retrieved in 2024 for the year 2023 using SIHA 2.1.

If we compare the same indicator previously reported in the 2023 GAM with the 2023 data generated using SIHA 2.1 in 2024, we can observe a discrepancy in the figures—from 2,847 to 4,106—for the indicator “Total number of people living with HIV newly enrolled on antiretroviral therapy who also started tuberculosis preventive treatment during the same reporting period” for the same year, 2023. 

If we make the same comparison for the indicator ""Total number of people living with HIV currently enrolled on antiretroviral therapy who started tuberculosis preventive treatment during the reporting period,"" there is a decrease from the previously reported 11,430 to 8,838. This suggests that some of the data previously reported were not migrated into the individual-based SIHA 2.1 system. 

If we look at the numbers for TPT therapy completion, there are two versions that can be generated: 7006 (SIHA 2.1) /11430 (Excel based) and 7006/8838 (all SIHA 2.1). For this indicator we prefer to report 7006 (SIHA 2.1) /11430 (Excel based).

MSG_ERROR_TB_COMPL_TPT_NUM_PREV_YEAR","Victoria Bendaud (UNAIDS) said on 19/05/25 at 08:18: El año pasado se reportó que [1385] personas que vivían con el VIH y estaban en tratamiento antirretroviral completaron el tratamiento preventivo contra la tuberculosis. Por favor, verifique si hay datos disponibles para este período de reporte. El denominador [2674] difiere del número de personas reportadas el año pasado que habían iniciado el tratamiento preventivo contra la tuberculosis en 2023 [2329]. Agradecemos puedan verificar o brindar una explicación para esta diferencia.

Ricardo Luque Núñez (MINISTRY) said on 31/05/25 at 18:30: La información de personas que viven con VIH, reciben terapia antirretroviral y completan un ciclo de tratamiento preventivo contra la tuberculosis se toma del informe de la Cuenta de Alto Costo, que es la fuente de información donde podemos identificar las personas que cumplen con estas 3 condiciones. La información a la Cuenta de Alto Costo se envía cuando se ha cumplido el período de reporte, es decir, del año completo. El último informe disponible corresponde al período 1 de febrero de 2023 a 31 de enero de 2024 (fundamentalmente año 2023). 

Revisando el informe final publicado (los datos antes reportados eran preliminares), para el período en mención (1 de febrero de 2023 al 31 de enero de 2024) 1.635 personas habían recibido tratamiento para TB latente con isoniacida, 132 lo recibieron con isoniacida/rifapentina, 1024 estaban aún es tratamiento con isoniacida y 77 estaban en tratamiento con isoniacida/rifapentina, lo que daría un denominador de 2.868 personas para el período en mención. Desafortunadamente para estos reportados hoy no contamos con las desagregaciones de edad y género 

Consideramos que reportarlo de esta manera, puede aclarar las diferencias que se tuvieron con años anteriores.
Debemos anotar que, en diálogo con el programa de tuberculosis, ellos solo tienen información de 1.590 personas que viven con VIH que recibieron tratamiento para TB latente en el año 2023, pero no cuentan con información de cuántos de ellos estaban en TAR, ni cuantos finalizaron el tratamiento. La diferencia con los datos reportados en este informe puede radicar en que cuando un paciente recibe el medicamento directamente de su aseguradora y no del programa de tuberculosis, es probable que no sea reportado al programa de TB.

Quedamos atentos a cualquier inquietud adicional.
