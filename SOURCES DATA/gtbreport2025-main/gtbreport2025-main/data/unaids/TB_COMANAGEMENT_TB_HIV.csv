This seems to reflect an important change. Please can you explain the reason for this or consult with the National TB Programme, review the data and revise accordingly.

Dr. Fazidah Yuswan (MINISTRY) said on 30/05/25 at 08:04: In Malaysia, there are established policies for HIV and TB screening that emphasize the integration of screening and management for coinfections. This includes conducting TB screenings for people living with HIV (PLHIV) and testing for HIV in individuals diagnosed with TB. Efforts also target high-risk environments, such as prisons and drug rehabilitation centers, for TB screening initiatives. 

To enhance antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, Malaysia is scaling up the use of the drug Dolutegravir (DTG), in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO). DTG, an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV, is recommended by WHO as part of both first-line and second-line ART for individuals with HIV, including adults and children. It is preferred due to its effectiveness, tolerability, and strong resistance barrier.

",Please verify and confirm that some numerators have changed by more than 20% compared to the previous year.,"Victoria Bendaud (UNAIDS) said on 19/05/25 at 08:17: It was reported that [1307] people living with HIV with TB on ART started TB treatment in 2023, compared to [4720] for 2024. This seems to reflect an important change. The National TB Programme has reported [1409] TB cases among people living with HIV on ART to WHO, which is different from the number of people living with HIV with TB on ART reported for this indicator [4720]. The National TB Programme has also reported [1526] TB cases among people living with HIV to WHO (irrespective of whether on ART). The number of people living with HIV with TB on ART reported for this indicator [4720] should not be greater than that. Please could you discuss with your colleagues in the National TB Programme and agree on the number to report.

Namarola Lote (WHO) said on 21/05/25 at 19:04: The 1409 is the TB patients diagnosed with HIV and started ART. The 4720 is the total active PLHIV (both new and current) who were started on TB treatment. 
The difference between the 2 years is due to TB drug supply issues in 2023.

The number from HIV program will always be higher than the TB program as HIV program is treating all active patients (new and current PLHIV) while TB is only for the new cases for that year.

The number of people living with HIV with TB on ART reported for this indicator [11006] should not be greater than that. We understand data reported through GAM may also include data available from the private sector. Please verify.

Jayne Eunice Yang (MINISTRY) said on 30/05/25 at 07:27: There are data discrepancies between the TB-HIV data reported by the National TB Program and the HIV Unit of the Epidemiology Bureau because of the different information systems being used. The TB Program uses the Integrated TB Information System (ITIS) which captures diagnosed TB patients, including indicators for TB-HIV. On the other hand, The HIV Unit uses the One HIV, AIDS, and STI Information System (OHASIS) which captures HIV-positive patients, including indicators on HIV patients with TB and given TB Preventive Treatment. TB-HIV data tend to be underreported.

Jayne Eunice Yang (MINISTRY) said on 02/06/25 at 06:05: Per agreement with the Philippine National AIDS Council, we deem the figures being reported in the OHASIS database to be more complete, since the cohort being requested for this indicator is on PLHIV.

- Couverture tests plus importante en 2024 (96%) qu'en 2023 (85%);
- Couverture traitement légèrement améliorée, 85% en 2023 contre 88% en 2024.
En effet, la stratégies de mise en réseaux des institutions et le fonctionnement des comités TB/VIH a tous les niveaux ont permis au PNLS et au PNLT de réaliser des progrès remarquables en 2024, notamment dans la sensibilisation des prestataires de soins et services et l'intensification du dépistage du VIH au niveau des centres de traitement de la TB (CDT). 
Selon la Coordination du PNLT, les départements du Sud et du Centre ont améliore l'offre de traitement en 2024 (93%). Au niveau de la plupart des sites a grand volume dans les départements (plus peuples) du Nord, de l'Artibonite et de l'Ouest, l'amélioration de l'enrôlement a favorisé une hausse de la couverture au niveau national.

Es de anotar que la diferencia entre estos 1.071 y los 1.005 pacientes reportados por el programa de tuberculosis en el año 2023 puede estar dada por la diferencia del periodo de corte (Programa de tuberculosis Enero a diciembre 2023 y Cuenta de Alto Costo 1 de febrero 2023 a 31 de enero 2024).

",Veuillez vérifier et confirmer que certains numérateurs ont changé de plus de 20% par rapport à l'année précédente.,"Victoria Bendaud (UNAIDS) said on 19/05/25 at 08:17: Il est rapporté que [398] personnes vivant avec le VIH et avec tuberculose sous TAR ont commencé un traitement contre la tuberculose en 2023, contre [510] en 2024. Cela semble refléter un changement important. Le Programme national de lutte contre la tuberculose a rapporté [390] cas de tuberculose parmi les personnes vivant avec le VIH sous TAR à l'OMS, ce qui diffère du nombre de personnes vivant avec le VIH et la tuberculité sous TAR rapporté pour cet indicateur [510]. Pourriez-vous discuter avec vos collègues du Programme national de lutte contre la tuberculose et vous mettre d'accord sur le nombre à rapporter.

Abalo LIMAZIE (MINISTRY) said on 04/06/25 at 15:10: Merci pour cette question.
Nous avions travaillé avec nos collegues du programme de Tuberculose qui ont rapporté dans le rapport annuel 392.
Nous avions corrigé la donnée rapportée

",Please verify and confirm that some numerators have changed by more than 20% compared to the previous year.,"Victoria Bendaud (UNAIDS) said on 19/05/25 at 08:17: The National TB Programme has reported [89] TB cases among people living with HIV on ART to WHO, which is different from the number of people living with HIV with TB on ART reported for this indicator [7]. Please could you discuss with your colleagues in the National TB Programme and agree on one value for this indicator.

Taliha Karakök (MINISTRY) said on 22/05/25 at 12:31: We discussed it with our colleagues in the National TB Programme and corrected the value to 89.
