**A Multi-Model Forecasting, Meta-Analytical, and Policy Scenario Assessment Platform**

This repository contains the code, data, and interactive tools for a comprehensive "Living Review" of the Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB) epidemic in India. It serves as the digital companion to the research manuscript authored by **Dr. Siddalingaiah H. S.**, providing transparency, reproducibility, and real-time scenario modeling capabilities for policymakers and researchers.

## 🎯 Project Overview

India stands at a critical juncture in its TB elimination journey. As we approach the 2025 targets, our research reveals a fundamental shift in the epidemic's nature: **Primary Transmission** (direct infection with resistant strains) is overtaking **Acquired Resistance** (treatment failure) as the dominant driver of MDR-TB.

This project aims to:
1.  **Forecast** the trajectory of TB and DR-TB notifications up to 2030 using advanced ML ensembles.
2.  **Quantify** the "New Case Paradox" — the rising proportion of resistant cases among treatment-naïve patients.
3.  **Map** sub-national hotspots to guide resource allocation.
4.  **Simulate** the impact of policy interventions (Active Case Finding, TPT, Universal BPaL) on future burden.

## 🏗️ Methodology

This research employs a rigorous mixed-methods approach:

*   **Evidence Synthesis:** A **Rapid Meta-Analysis** of 5 recent prevalence studies (N > 150,000) validated a baseline primary resistance rate of **3.64%**.
*   **Ensemble Forecasting:** A weighted consensus model combining:
    *   *Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing* (Trend/Seasonality)
    *   *ARIMA* (Auto-regressive dynamics)
    *   *XGBoost Linear* (Structural growth extrapolation)
    *   *Bayesian Ridge Regression* (95% Uncertainty Quantification)
*   **Scenario Modeling:** Deterministic sensitivity analysis simulating three futures:
    1.  *Status Quo*
    2.  *Treatment Optimization (Universal BPaL/M)*
    3.  *Combination Strategy (Prevention First + Treatment)*

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard

We have developed a **Streamlit Dashboard** to allow users to interact with the data directly.

### Features:
*   **National Forecast:** Zoom into the 2025–2030 trajectory with uncertainty bounds.
*   **State Hotspots:** Sort states by *Volume* (Total Cases) or *Intensity* (% Resistance) to identify high-priority zones.
*   **Policy Simulator:** "What-If" calculator to adjust TPT and BPaL coverage efficiency and see the impact on lives saved.

### How to Run Locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hssling/drtb_projections_modelling.git
    cd drtb_projections_modelling
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements_dashboard.txt
    ```

3.  **Launch Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard_app.py
    ```

## 🗝️ Key Findings & Policy Implications

| Finding | Interpretation | Policy Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Case Paradox** | By 2030, **67%** of DR-TB cases will be in *new* patients. | **Stop Risk-Based Screening.** Implement Universal Upfront NAAT for *all* patients. |
| **Hotspot Heterogeneity** | **Maharashtra** & **Delhi** have distinct high-intensity epidemics compared to UP/Bihar. | **Differential Strategies:** Focus on transmission breaking in urban metros; volume management in plains. |
| **Cost of Inaction** | Status Quo leads to **3 Million** cases/year by 2030. | **Prevention is Key.** Curative approaches alone (BPaL) save only 11%. Combination (TPT+ACF) saves 47%. |
