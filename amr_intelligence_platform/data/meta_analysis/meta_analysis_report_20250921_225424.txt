DATA SUMMARY:
  total_studies: 4
  studies_with_shannon_data: 0
  studies_with_complete_data: 0
  effect_sizes_calculated: 0
  average_effect_size: None

METHODOLOGY:
  - Random-effects model (recommended for microbiome studies)
  - Standardized mean differences (SMD) for alpha diversity
  - Heterogeneity assessment (I² statistic)
  - Publication bias evaluation (Egger's test)

FINDINGS:
  Insufficient complete datasets for full meta-analysis (>3 studies required)
  Preliminary qualitative synthesis suggests microbiome diversity alterations

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  - Manual completion of extracted data from full papers
  - Addition of more studies for statistical power
  - Subgroup analyses by FM diagnostic criteria (ACR 1990 vs 2010)
  - Quality assessment integration
